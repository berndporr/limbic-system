</H1>

<P>
Review papers by Michelsen and Schmitz (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Michelsen2007">Michelsen et&nbsp;al., 2007</A>) and (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Nakamura2013">Nakamura, 2013</A>).

<P>
The DRN seems to generate 5HT to “wait to obtain a reward” behaviour  (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Nakamura2013">Nakamura, 2013</A>).

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000111000000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">10</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> Afferents</A>
</H2>

<P>
A detailed tracing / optogenetic study can be found here  (<A
 HREF="node16.html#PollakDorocic2014">Pollak&nbsp;Dorocic et&nbsp;al., 2014</A>).

<P>
LHb, mPFC and LH appear to be the main afferents to the DRN (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Vertes2010">Vertes et&nbsp;al., 2010</A>) (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Sparta2014">Sparta and Stuber, 2014</A>) (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Lee2003">Lee et&nbsp;al., 2003</A>).

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION000111100000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">10</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> OFC to DRN</A>
</H3>

<P>
The OFC has strong reciprocal connections to with DRN (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Zhou2015">Zhou et&nbsp;al., 2015</A>) where the OFC is probably the main nucleus of the DRN's ability to track the long term anticipated reward and reversal learning (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Roberts2011">Roberts, 2011</A>).

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION000111200000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">10</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> mPFC to DRN</A>
</H3>

<P>
The mPFC (in particular its ventral part) has GLU projections to the DRN (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Goncalves2009">Gon&#231;alves et&nbsp;al., 2009</A>) (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Lee2003">Lee et&nbsp;al., 2003</A>).

<P>
The conventional view is that the mPFC’s glutamergic projections to the DRN connect to locally inhibitory neurons that then target 5HT neurons (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Celada2001">Celada et&nbsp;al., 2001</A>). Stimulation of mPFC neurons usually inhibit DRN neurons which makes a strong case for these scenario.

<P>
However, (<A
 HREF="node16.html#PollakDorocic2014">Pollak&nbsp;Dorocic et&nbsp;al., 2014</A>) found that the mPFC has direct excitatory control of 5HT which they consider to be potentially critical for the correct function of the serotonergic system. 

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION000111300000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">10</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN> LHb to DRN</A>
</H3>

<P>
Similarly with regards to LHb projections to the DRN the conventional view is that the LHb neurons
target local GABA neurons that then inhibit 5HT. However, (<A
 HREF="node16.html#PollakDorocic2014">Pollak&nbsp;Dorocic et&nbsp;al., 2014</A>) found a direct connection to the DRN. Contrary to (<A
 HREF="node16.html#PollakDorocic2014">Pollak&nbsp;Dorocic et&nbsp;al., 2014</A>), (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Ogawa2014">Ogawa et&nbsp;al., 2014</A>) found few monosynaptic connections from the LHb to the DRN and instead posits that the LHb inhibits DRN 5HT via the rostral medial tegmental nucleus (RMTg). This has also been confirmed by (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Sego2014">Sego et&nbsp;al., 2014</A>).

<P>
Overall the picture emerges that the LHb exerts its influence via the RMTg and that direct connections from the LHb to the DRN are rare.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION000111400000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">10</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN> LH to DRN</A>
</H3>

<P>
Strong monosynaptic glutamatergic projections have been shown by (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Lee2003">Lee et&nbsp;al., 2003</A>) and (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Aghajanian1990">Aghajanian et&nbsp;al., 1990</A>). It's interesting that of these most prominent projections mentioned above it appears that this is the only excitatory one.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION000111500000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">10</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN> Amygdala to DRN</A>
</H3>

<P>
Tracing studies have shown robust projections from the Amygdala (CEA) to the DRN (<A
 HREF="node16.html#PollakDorocic2014">Pollak&nbsp;Dorocic et&nbsp;al., 2014</A>) which are monosynaptic and are most likely glutamatergic (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Swanson1998">Swanson and Petrovich, 1998</A>). In contrast to the GABAergic inputs above this seems to be one of the few excitatory inputs.

<P>
Several nuclei from the basal ganglia project to the DRN including SNr and globus pallidus which is inhibitory in nature (<A

<P>
The paper by  (<A

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">10</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> Efferents</A>
</H2>

<P>
Most recently the projections to the limbic cortices have been identified as the strongest (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Linley2013">Linley et&nbsp;al., 2013</A>) (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Roberts2011">Roberts, 2011</A>) whereas in this older publication (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Reisine1984">Reisine et&nbsp;al., 1984</A>) states that the DRN projects to the striatum and caudate nucleus. 

<P>
The paper by (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Vertes2010">Vertes et&nbsp;al., 2010</A>) claims the DRN efferents include the VTA, SNc, LH and NAcc core. (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Nakamura2013">Nakamura, 2013</A>) stresses the projections from the DRN to the SNr, the VTA (inhibitory), amygdala, cortex (with inhibition of the mPFC) and to the NAcc where 5HT has at least partially a disinhibitory effect by targeting interneurons.

<P>
The actual effect of 5HT depends on the prominent receptor type in the target area. Some 5HT receptors are excitatory, some inhibibitory and some ramp up plasticity (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Frazer1999">Frazer and Hensler, 1999</A>).

<P>
The review paper by (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Michelsen2007">Michelsen et&nbsp;al., 2007</A>) makes a distinction between dorsal, medial and ventral pathways:

This pathway targets a large number of different limbic nuclei. In order of density:

<P>
* Septum (dense)
  * Amygdala (dense)
  * Habenula (dense)
  * Piriform, insular and frontal cortices (dense)
  * Occipital, entorhinal, perirhinal, frontal orbital, anterior cingulate and infralimbic cortices (moderate)

  * Olfactory bulb. (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Lottem2016">Lottem et&nbsp;al., 2016</A>) has shown that the spontaneous activity of the olfactory cortex is suppressed by 5HT release but that odor evoked activity is unaffacted by 5HT.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">10</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN> Receptors</A>
</H2>

<P>
In contrast to dopamine 5HT has a vast array of different receptors. While the DRN and MRN generate a global 5HT signal the effects on different brains areas can be vastly different because of every brain area has their own 5HT receptor distribution (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Palacios1990">Palacios et&nbsp;al., 1990</A>) (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Carhart-Harris2017">Carhart-Harris and Nutt, 2017</A>). Before we go into the efferents we present the different receptors and where they are located. If not otherwise cited it's based on the review by (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Mengod2010">Mengod et&nbsp;al., 2010</A>) and the classic (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Palacios1990">Palacios et&nbsp;al., 1990</A>).

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION000113100000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">10</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> 5HTR1</A>
</H3>

<P>
The 5HTR1 has numerous subclasses:
  * 5HTR1A receptors are found on excitatory/pyramidal neurons and inhibit those. This receptor has been called the "limbic" receptor because it is prominent in the limbic areas of the brain: hippocampus, lateral septum, cortex (cingulate/entorhinal) and raphe nucleus. These receptors are often co-expressed with the excitatory 5HT2A receptor. They are located on the soma or dendrite and thus can inhibit the firing of neurons (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Riad2000">Riad et&nbsp;al., 2000</A>).
  * 5HTR1B are found mainly on inhibitory neurons and inhibit those but occasionally also on pyramidal neurons. They are very prominent in the basal ganglia, in particular in the GP, SNR, VP and EP (which are the output nuclei of the BG). They are both auto and heterosynaptic receptors and are located at the axon terminals (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Riad2000">Riad et&nbsp;al., 2000</A>) and control rather the release of transmitter in contrast to 5HTR1A which control spiking.
  * 5HTR1D are located in the caudate putamen, Nacc, olfactory cortex, dorsal raphe nucleus und locus coeruleus. It's predominantly located on axon terminals of both 5HT and and non 5HT neurons and inhibit release of neurotransmitters.
  * 5HTR1E is prominent in the (entorhinal) cortex, caudate putamen and claustrum.
  * 5HTR1F has its highest levels in the cortical regions, olfactory bulb, Nacc, parascicular nucleus, thalamus, medial mamillary nucleus, hippocampus, subiculum and amygdala.

<P>
Having both inhibitory 5HT receptors on both excitatory and inhibitory neurons means that this can cancel out in average but will possibly change the dynamics of the network.

<P>

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">10</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> 5HTR2</A>
</H3>

<P>
* 5HTR2A: These receptors are excitatory and enhancing inputs when activated meaning they are located on dendrites and on the soma. These receptors are very prominent in the cortex and have been localised on GABAergic interneurons but also glutamatergic projection neurons.
  * 5HTR2B: it's function and localisation is still poorly understood
  * 5HTR2C: has only been found in the CNS and there in the choroid plexus, cortex, NAcc, hippocampus, amygdala, caudate and SNr. They are also postsynaptic but might be also presynaptic.

</H3>

<P>
It's highest concentration is in the dorsal vagal complex of the brainstem. 

<P>
Is a fast excitatory receptor which is mainly located in the hippocampus (and possibly amygdala) (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Palacios1990">Palacios et&nbsp;al., 1990</A>) and is co-expressed with GLU receptors in the hippocampus.

<P>
Some evidence points to it controlling DA release (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Mengod2010">Mengod et&nbsp;al., 2010</A>).

<P>

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">10</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN> 5HTR4</A>
</H3>

<P>
This receptor seems to control primarily plasticity, for both LTP and LTD (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Penas-Cazorla2015">Pe&#241;as-Cazorla and Vilar&#243;, 2015</A>). In an experiment by (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Mlinar2006">Mlinar et&nbsp;al., 2006</A>) stimulation of this receptor causes LTP in hippocampal slices which were very long lasting for over 2hrs.

<P>
Even more impressive are the findings by (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Hagena2017">Hagena and Manahan-Vaughan, 2017</A>) who show that 5HTR4 activation shifts the frequency threshold between LTD and LTP: it is generally accepted that under LFS LTD is induced whereas under HFS LTP is induced. The frequency threshold where LTD turns into LTP can be shifted by the 5HTR4 receptor. If this receptor is stimulated even lower frequencies can cause LTP which otherwise would have caused LTD!

<P>
In the rat it is located mainly in the limbic system: hippocampus, striatum, inferior colliculus, SNr, ventral pallidum, fundus striatae, olfactory tubercle, septum and amygdala. It has also high concentrations in the parietal cortex.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000114000000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">10</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN> Activity</A>
</H2>

<P>
As shown by (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Li2016">Li et&nbsp;al., 2016</A>): the activity increases when "when a mouse voluntarily seeks and acquires sucrose, food, sex and social interaction". 5HT neurons are activated by surprising reward events (such as VTA neurons do) and reward predicting cues is presented. The activity only drops off after the reward has been experienced. In particular the DRN activity stays active while the animal is waiting for a reward.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000115000000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">10</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN> Behavioural studies</A>
</H2>

<P>
Numerous studies have reported that 5HT is required for delayed reward scenarios, for example where a rat has to wait in front of a dispenser to retrieve a reward (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Khani2016">Khani and Rainer, 2016</A>) as already mentioned above where the activity was measured during a delayed reward scenario (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Li2016">Li et&nbsp;al., 2016</A>).

<P>
This has been combined into the proposal by (<A
 HREF="#Miyazaki2012">, </A>) that 5HT controls patience and reward.

<P>
Premature responding is increased after (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Fletcher2007">Fletcher et&nbsp;al., 2007</A>) application of a 5HT(2A) receptor antagonist and decreased after 5-HT(2C) application. In earlier studies impulsivity could also be increased by 5HT depletion (<A
 HREF="node16.html#Harrison1997">Harrison et&nbsp;al., 1997</A>).
