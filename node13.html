A detailed tracing / optogenetic study can be found in
<A
 HREF="node17.html#PollakDorocic2014">Pollak&nbsp;Dorocic et&nbsp;al. (2014)</A>. LHb, mPFC and LH appear to be the main

<P>

<H3><A ID="SECTION000131100000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">12</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> OFC to DRN</A>
</H3>
The OFC has strong reciprocal connections to with DRN (<A
 HREF="node17.html#Zhou2015">Zhou et&nbsp;al., 2015</A>)
where the OFC is probably the main nucleus of the DRN's ability to
track the long term anticipated reward and reversal learning
(<A
 HREF="node17.html#Roberts2011">Roberts, 2011</A>).

<P>

<H3><A ID="SECTION000131200000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">12</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> mPFC to DRN</A>
</H3>
The mPFC (in particular its ventral part) has GLU projections to the
DRN (<A ID="tex2html247" target="contents"
  HREF="node17.html#Goncalves2009">Gonçalves et&nbsp;al., 2009</A>; <A ID="tex2html248" target="contents"
  HREF="node17.html#Lee2003">Lee et&nbsp;al., 2003</A>).

<P>
The conventional view is that the mPFC’s glutamatergic projections to
the DRN connect to locally inhibitory neurons that then target 5HT
neurons (<A
 HREF="node17.html#Celada2001">Celada et&nbsp;al., 2001</A>). Stimulation of mPFC neurons usually
inhibit DRN neurons which makes a strong case for these scenario.

<P>
However, (<A
 HREF="node17.html#PollakDorocic2014">Pollak&nbsp;Dorocic et&nbsp;al., 2014</A>) found that the mPFC has direct
excitatory control of 5HT which they consider to be potentially
critical for the correct function of the serotonergic system.

<P>

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">12</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN> LHb to DRN</A>
</H3>
Similarly with regards to LHb projections to the DRN the conventional
view is that the LHb neurons target local GABA neurons that then
inhibit 5HT. However, (<A
 HREF="node17.html#PollakDorocic2014">Pollak&nbsp;Dorocic et&nbsp;al., 2014</A>) found a direct
connection to the DRN. Contrary to (<A
 HREF="node17.html#PollakDorocic2014">Pollak&nbsp;Dorocic et&nbsp;al., 2014</A>),
(<A
 HREF="node17.html#Ogawa2014">Ogawa et&nbsp;al., 2014</A>) found few monosynaptic connections from the LHb to
the DRN and instead posits that the LHb inhibits DRN 5HT via the
rostral medial tegmental nucleus (RMTg). This has also been confirmed
by (<A
 HREF="node17.html#Sego2014">Sego et&nbsp;al., 2014</A>).

<P>
Overall the picture emerges that the LHb exerts its influence via the
RMTg and that direct connections from the LHb to the DRN are rare.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">12</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN> LH to DRN</A>

Strong monosynaptic glutamatergic projections have been shown by
(<A

 HREF="node17.html#Aghajanian1990">Aghajanian et&nbsp;al., 1990</A>). It's interesting that of
these most prominent projections mentioned above it appears that this
is the only excitatory one.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">12</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN> Amygdala to DRN</A>

Tracing studies have shown robust projections from the Amygdala (CEA)
to the DRN (<A
 HREF="node17.html#PollakDorocic2014">Pollak&nbsp;Dorocic et&nbsp;al., 2014</A>) which are monosynaptic and are
most likely glutamatergic (<A
 HREF="node17.html#Swanson1998">Swanson and Petrovich, 1998</A>). In contrast to the
GABAergic inputs above this seems to be one of the few excitatory
inputs.

The paper by <A

Most recently the projections to the limbic cortices have been
identified as the strongest (<A
 HREF="node17.html#Linley2013">Linley et&nbsp;al., 2013</A>) (<A
 HREF="node17.html#Roberts2011">Roberts, 2011</A>)
whereas in this older publication (<A
 HREF="node17.html#Reisine1984">Reisine et&nbsp;al., 1984</A>) states that the
DRN projects to the striatum and caudate nucleus.

<P>
The paper by (<A
 HREF="node17.html#Vertes2010">Vertes et&nbsp;al., 2010</A>) claims the DRN efferents include the
VTA, SNc, LH and NAcc core. (<A
 HREF="node17.html#Nakamura2013">Nakamura, 2013</A>) stresses the
projections from the DRN to the SNr, the VTA (inhibitory), amygdala,
cortex (with inhibition of the mPFC) and to the NAcc where 5HT has at
least partially a disinhibitory effect by targeting interneurons.

<P>
The actual effect of 5HT depends on the prominent receptor type in the
target area. Some 5HT receptors are excitatory, some inhibitory and
some ramp up plasticity (<A
 HREF="node17.html#Frazer1999">Frazer and Hensler, 1999</A>).

<P>
The review paper by <A
 HREF="node17.html#Michelsen2007">Michelsen et&nbsp;al. (2007)</A> makes a distinction between
dorsal, medial and ventral pathways:

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">12</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN> Receptors</A>
</H2>
In contrast to dopamine 5HT has a vast array of different
receptors. While the DRN and MRN generate a global 5HT signal the
effects on different brains areas can be vastly different because of
every brain area has their own 5HT receptor distribution
(<A
 HREF="node17.html#Palacios1990">Palacios et&nbsp;al., 1990</A>) (<A
 HREF="node17.html#Carhart-Harris2017">Carhart-Harris and Nutt, 2017</A>). Before we go into the
efferents we present the different receptors and where they are
located. If not otherwise cited it's based on the review by

</H3>
The 5HTR1 has numerous subclasses:

<UL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">5HTR1A</SPAN> receptors are found on excitatory/pyramidal neurons and
    inhibit those. This receptor has been called the "limbic" receptor
    because it is prominent in the limbic areas of the brain:
    hippocampus, lateral septum, cortex (cingulate/entorhinal) and
    Raphe nucleus. These receptors are often co-expressed with the
    excitatory 5HT2A receptor. They are located on the soma or
    dendrite and thus can inhibit the firing of neurons
    (<A
 HREF="node17.html#Riad2000">Riad et&nbsp;al., 2000</A>).
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">5HTR1B</SPAN> are found mainly on inhibitory neurons and inhibit
    those but occasionally also on pyramidal neurons. They are very
    prominent in the basal ganglia, in particular in the GP, SNR, VP
    and EP (which are the output nuclei of the BG). They are both auto
    and heterosynaptic receptors and are located at the axon terminals
    (<A
 HREF="node17.html#Riad2000">Riad et&nbsp;al., 2000</A>) and control rather the release of transmitter in
    contrast to 5HTR1A which control spiking.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">5HTR1D</SPAN> are located in the caudate putamen, Nacc, olfactory
    cortex, dorsal Raphe nucleus and locus ceruleus. It's
    predominantly located on axon terminals of both 5HT and and non
    5HT neurons and inhibit release of neurotransmitters.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">5HTR1E</SPAN> is prominent in the (entorhinal) cortex, caudate
    putamen and claustrum.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">5HTR1F</SPAN> has its highest levels in the cortical regions,
    olfactory bulb, Nacc, parascicular nucleus, thalamus, medial
    mamillary nucleus, hippocampus, subiculum and amygdala.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Having both inhibitory 5HT receptors on both excitatory and inhibitory
neurons means that this can cancel out in average but will possibly
change the dynamics of the network.

<UL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">5HTR2A</SPAN>: These receptors are excitatory and enhancing
    inputs when activated meaning they are located on dendrites and on

Is a fast excitatory receptor which is mainly located in the
hippocampus (and possibly amygdala) (<A

co-expressed with GLU receptors in the hippocampus.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">12</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN> 5HTR4</A>
</H3>
This receptor seems to control primarily plasticity, for both LTP and
LTD (<A
 HREF="node17.html#Penas-Cazorla2015">Peñas-Cazorla and Vilaró, 2015</A>). In an experiment by (<A
 HREF="node17.html#Mlinar2006">Mlinar et&nbsp;al., 2006</A>)
stimulation of this receptor causes LTP in hippocampal slices which
were very long lasting for over 2hrs.

<P>
Even more impressive are the findings by (<A
 HREF="node17.html#Hagena2017">Hagena and Manahan-Vaughan, 2017</A>) who show
that 5HTR4 activation shifts the frequency threshold between LTD and
LTP: it is generally accepted that under LFS LTD is induced whereas
under HFS LTP is induced. The frequency threshold where LTD turns into
LTP can be shifted by the 5HTR4 receptor. If this receptor is
stimulated even lower frequencies can cause LTP which otherwise would
have caused LTD!

<P>
In the rat it is located mainly in the limbic system: hippocampus,
striatum, inferior colliculus, SNr, ventral pallidum, fundus striatae,
olfactory tubercle, septum and amygdala. It has also high
concentrations in the parietal cortex.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">12</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN> Activity</A>
</H2>
As shown by (<A
 HREF="node17.html#Li2016">Li et&nbsp;al., 2016</A>): the activity increases when "when a mouse
voluntarily seeks and acquires sucrose, food, sex and social
interaction". 5HT neurons are activated by surprising reward events
(such as VTA neurons do) and reward predicting cues is presented. The
activity only drops off after the reward has been experienced. In
particular the DRN activity stays active while the animal is waiting
for a reward.

Numerous studies have reported that 5HT is required for delayed reward
scenarios, for example where a rat has to wait in front of a dispenser
to retrieve a reward (<A
 HREF="node17.html#Khani2016">Khani and Rainer, 2016</A>) as already mentioned above
where the activity was measured during a delayed reward scenario
(<A
 HREF="node17.html#Li2016">Li et&nbsp;al., 2016</A>).

<P>
This has been combined into the proposal by (<A
 HREF="node17.html#Miyazaki2012">Miyazaki et&nbsp;al., 2012</A>) that
5HT controls patience and reward.

<P>
Premature responding is increased after (<A
 HREF="node17.html#Fletcher2007">Fletcher et&nbsp;al., 2007</A>)
application of a 5HT(2A) receptor antagonist and decreased after
5-HT(2C) application. In earlier studies impulsivity could also be
increased by 5HT depletion (<A
