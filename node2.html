<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> Introduction</A>
</H1>
This document is a hybrid of a map and commenting text
underneath which in turn points to references which back up the
connections.

<P>
In contrast to &ldquo;self-organised&rdquo; models which assume that data
organises itself to a brain map, this project strongly believes
that <SPAN  CLASS="textsl">curation</SPAN> is essential. There are a number of reasons:

<UL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Bias</SPAN>: We assume <SPAN  CLASS="textsl">every paper</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textsl">every
  dataset</SPAN> is to a certain degree biased - be it subconscious,
  conscious or deliberate. It should be a no-brainer. It is thus
  important to compare different views and then draw conclusions which
  most likely reflect what is really happening in the rat brain.
  The advantage as a computational neuroscientist (who has also
  extensive experience in wet-neuroscience) is that I can step
  back and can talk to different camps to find out different
  intentions and slants. On the other hand as a
  computational neuroscientist of course the danger is that I
  force popular machine learning models on neuroscience. For
  that reason this map here makes no attempt to be mathematically
  pure. For example there is no attempt to force TD learning
  onto this map.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Uncertainty of the data</SPAN>: neurophysiological data never
  provides 100% certainty. Data is noisy and there will be almost
  every time a study which contradicts the current state of the
  art. However, through experience one learns to distinguish between
  spurious results and those which will consolidate. This is not a
  simple process eliminating outliers but to look at the studies from
  the curator's experience because a hype or fashion can generate
  a large amount of publications and again requires stepping back
  and evaluating publications with possibly at a 10year timeframe to
  check which of these findings have been reproduced from different
  sources and over years.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Closed loop / Embodied</SPAN>: At the end an animal needs to
  act in its environment as the limbic system make an animal finding
  rewards (and punishments). This dictates a certain direction of
  information flow from sensor to motor and then <SPAN  CLASS="textsl">back</SPAN> to the
  sensor via the environment. This is only possible by taking into
  account closed loop and using this as a constraint. The whole map
  needs to be able to establish a (real or simulated) rat performing
  reward related behavioural experiments, for example reversal
  learning. This constraint demands that the map needs to be seen
  always as a whole and being embedded in an environment.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
In summary: human curation of data here is as important as humans
generating both data and publications. So far no algorithm can
fix this. A brain searching for rewards cannot do this while swimming
in a vat and thus requires to be embodied.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> Review articles</A>
</H2>

<UL>
<LI>This article by Castro and Berridge promotes their long standing
  differentiation between 'wanting' and 'liking' (<A
 HREF="node14.html#Berridge2009">Berridge, 2009</A>)
  now updated by 'hedonic hot spots' (<A
 HREF="node14.html#Castro2015">Castro et&nbsp;al., 2015</A>).
</LI>
<LI>Berthoud's article features fantastic connection diagrams
  between the different nuclei of the limbic system
  (<A
 HREF="node14.html#Berthoud04">Berthoud, 2004</A>).
</LI>
<LI>Zahm again provides very detailed anatomical connection diagrams
  and is a must read (<A
 HREF="node14.html#Zahm00">Zahm, 2000</A>).
</LI>
<LI>The review by Abbas Khani and Gregor Rainer focusses on the
  roles of the different nuclei, how they interact, how they implement
  reinforcement guided decision making and which forms are out there
  (reversal, go no go etc). A very balanced article which, for
  example, not just cites the prediction error paradigm of DA but
  reports also the other roles DA (<A
 HREF="node14.html#Khani2016">Khani and Rainer, 2016</A>).
