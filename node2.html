<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> Introduction</A>
</H1>
This document is a hybrid of a map and commenting text
underneath which in turn points to references which back up the
connections.

<P>
In contrast to &ldquo;self-organised&rdquo; models which assume that
&ldquo;objective&rdquo; data organises itself to a brain map, this project
strongly believes that <SPAN  CLASS="textsl">curation</SPAN> by a human is
essential. There are a number of reasons:

<UL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Data and papers are biased</SPAN>: We assume <SPAN  CLASS="textsl">every
  paper</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textsl">every dataset</SPAN> is biased - be it subconscious,
  conscious or deliberate. It should be a no-brainer as it's generated
  by humans for humans. It is thus important to compare different
  views and then draw conclusions which most likely reflects what is
  actually happening in the rat brain. I'm a computational
  neuroscientist. This is both benefit and curse.  The advantage is
  that I can step back and can talk to different camps to find out
  different intentions, slants or spin. On the other hand the danger
  is that I force popular machine learning models onto
  neuroscience. For that reason this map here makes no attempt to be
  mathematically pure. For example there is no attempt to force TD
  or deep learning onto this map.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Uncertainty of the data</SPAN>: Neurophysiological data
  rarely provides 100% certainty and a clear-cut
  interpretation. Data is noisy and there will be almost every time a
  study which contradicts the current state of the art. However,
  through experience one learns to distinguish between spurious
  results and those which will consolidate. This is not a simple
  process eliminating outliers but to look at the studies from the
  curator's experience because a spurious result can still trigger a
  large amount of publications and again requires stepping back and
  evaluating publications with possibly at a 10&nbsp;year timeframe to check
  which of these findings have been reproduced from different sources
  and over years.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Closed loop / Embodied</SPAN>: Crucially, an animal needs to
  act in its environment because the limbic system makes an animal
  finding rewards (and avoiding punishments). This means that the
  animal generates actions and evaluates the resulting sensor inputs
  which in turn generate actions and so forth. The whole map needs to
  be able to establish a (real or simulated) rat performing reward
  related behaviour, for example reversal learning. This constraint
  demands that the limbic map needs to be seen always as a whole
  embedded in its environment.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
In summary: human curation of data is as important as humans
generating both data and publications. So far no algorithm can
fix this. A brain searching for rewards cannot do this while swimming
in a vat and thus requires to be embodied.
