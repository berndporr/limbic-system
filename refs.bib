  abstract =	 "{Drug addiction can be conceptualized as a
                  disturbance of behavior motivated by
                  drug-conditioned incentives. This abnormality has
                  been explained by Incentive-Sensitization and
                  Allostatic-Counteradaptive theories as the result of
                  non-associative mechanisms acting at the stage of
                  the expression of incentive motivation and
                  responding for drug reinforcement. Each one of these
                  theories, however, does not account per se for two
                  basic properties of the motivational disturbance of
                  drug addiction: (1). focussing on drug- at the
                  expenses of non-drug-incentives; (2). virtual
                  irreversibility. To account for the above aspects we
                  have proposed an associative learning
                  hypothesis. According to this hypothesis the basic
                  disturbance of drug addiction takes place at the
                  stage of acquisition of motivation and in particular
                  of Pavlovian incentive learning. Drugs share with
                  non-drug rewards the property of stimulating
                  dopamine (DA) transmission in the nucleus accumbens
                  shell but this effect does not undergo habituation
                  upon repeated drug exposure, as instead is the case
                  of non-drug rewards. Repetitive, non-decremental
                  stimulation of DA transmission by drugs in the
                  nucleus accumbens septi (NAc) shell abnormally
                  strengthens stimulus-drug associations. Thus,
                  stimuli contingent upon drug reward acquire powerful
                  incentive properties after a relatively limited
                  number of predictive associations with the drug and
                  become particularly resistant to
                  extinction. Non-contingent occurrence of
                  drug-conditioned incentive cues or contexts strongly
                  facilitates and eventually reinstates drug
                  self-administration. Repeated drug exposure also
                  induces a process of sensitization of drug-induced
                  stimulation of DA transmission in the NAc core. The
                  precise significance of this adaptive change for the
                  mechanism of drug addiction is unclear given the
                  complexity and uncertainties surrounding the role of
                  NAc core DA in responding but might be more directly
                  related to instrumental performance.}",

                  activate target neurons sufficiently to induce
                  synaptic potentiation will instead cause a specific
                  synaptic depression. To realize this situation
                  experimentally, the Schaffer collateral projection
                  to area CA1 in rat hippocampal slices was stimulated
                  electrically at frequencies ranging from 0.5 to 50
                  Hz. Nine hundred pulses at 1-3 Hz consistently
                  yielded a depression of the CA1 population
                  excitatory postsynaptic potential that persisted
                  without signs of recovery for greater than 1 hr
                  after cessation of the conditioning
                  stimulation. This long-term depression was specific
                  to the conditioned input, ruling out generalized
                  changes in postsynaptic responsiveness or
                  excitability. Three lines of evidence suggest that
                  this effect is accounted for by a modification of
                  synaptic effectiveness rather than damage to or
                  fatigue of the stimulated inputs. First, the effect
                  was dependent on the stimulation frequency; 900
                  pulses at 10 Hz caused no lasting change, and at 50
                  Hz a synaptic potentiation was usually
                  observed. Second, the depressed synapses continued
                  to support long-term potentiation in response to a
                  high-frequency tetanus. Third, the effects of
                  conditioning stimulation could be prevented by
                  application of NMDA receptor antagonists. Thus, our
                  data suggest that synaptic depression can be
                  triggered by prolonged NMDA receptor activation that
                  is below the threshold for inducing synaptic
                  potentiation. We propose that this mechanism is
                  important for the modifications of hippocampal
                  response properties that underlie some forms of
                  learning and memory.}",

                  injection sites. In the CR studies, D-amphetamine
                  injected into both sites potentiated responding for
                  a CR previously paired with food delivery, without
                  altering responding on an inactive lever. Picrotoxin
                  injected into the ventral pallidum reduced
                  responding and abolished the selectivity of
                  responding for CR. The results show that DA release
                  in the ventral pallidum enhances locomotion and
                  responding for a CR, providing evidence that DA in
                  the ventral pallidum plays a significant role in the
                  mediation of the effects of D-amphetamine. The
                  failure of picrotoxin to elevate responding for CR
                  despite increasing locomotor activity indicates that
                  pharmacologically-induced blockade of GABAA

                  receptor antagonist CPP abolished the potentiation
                  of hippocampal-evoked activity and produced a D(2)
                  receptor-mediated suppression of evoked firing. In
                  neurons that received converging input from the
                  hippocampus and BLA, fimbria tetanus potentiated
                  hippocampal-evoked firing activity and suppressed
                  BLA-evoked activity in the same neurons. Both D(1)
                  and NMDA receptors participated in the potentiation
                  of fimbria-evoked activity, whereas the suppression
                  of BLA-evoked activity was blocked by either D(1)
                  receptor antagonism with SCH23390 or the adenosine

                  changes in extracellular DA in the nucleus accumbens

                  motivational, and sensory information, the new
                  findings also shed light on fast DA
                  neurotransmission in a behavioral context. This
                  report, (1). summarizes the information obtained by
                  electrophysiological and real-time voltammetric
                  approaches and (2). describes a general model of
                  phasic DA signaling in the NAc that links the
                  observed changes in DA electrical activity and
                  extracellular dynamics. The analysis demonstrates
                  that the behaviorally evoked DA transients are
                  governed by similar mechanisms as those produced by
                  short trains of electrical stimulation. Thus, action
                  potential-dependent release and presynaptic uptake
                  are primary determinants of functional DA levels in

                  generated at DA cell bodies produces markedly
                  different DA dynamics in forebrain projection
                  fields. The distinct changes result from
                  heterogeneous release and uptake rates and may
                  underlie region-specific effects of DA. Auto- and

  abstract =	 "{Two recent papers have questioned the concept of
                  the amygdala as a functional and anatomically
                  separate entity. Swanson and Petrovich go so far as
                  to state that ''the amygdala is neither a structural
                  nor a functional unit.'' This novel concept is
                  derived from the fact that the amygdala is a
                  structure whose anatomical connections and
                  neurochemical features are more strongly
                  interrelated to adjacent parts of the temporal lobe
                  and basal forebrain than to unique characteristics
                  of its own. This is an emerging hypothetical concept

                  many parts of this volume and merits further
                  examination in the future. The basal forebrain and
                  cortical circuitry described here seem to be
                  critical for a set of behaviors/processes that could
                  be collectively described as cognitive-emotive. For
                  example, this would include arousal, attention,
                  sensory processing, reinforcement, and finally
                  associative learning, decision making, and
                  memory. Collectively this circuitry influences the
                  emotional, motivational, and cognitive state of an
                  organism. More and more studies are demonstrating
                  that small and localized manipulations of the brain
                  can result in equally subtle and specific deficits
                  that are associated with definable parts of the
                  anatomical circuitry, neurotransmitters, and
                  receptors of basal forebrain structures. These
                  studies have been guided and influenced by the
                  refined neuroanatomical and neurochemical
                  investigations of Lennart Heimer and his
                  colleagues. Interpretations of these studies are

                  show, by immunogold electron microscopy in

                  and co-exocytosed with GABA from synaptic vesicles
                  in nerve endings assumed to be inhibitory on dentate

                  double labeling cytochemistry in perfusion fixed

                  terminals forming symmetric synaptic specializations
                  on perikarya of granule and pyramidal cells express
                  NMDA receptors. In addition, NMDA receptors are
                  present at synapses on granule cell bodies that have
                  asymmetric synaptic specializations and contain high
                  levels of GABA. Glutamate levels are low in the

                  but high in terminals making asymmetric synapses on

                  on NMDA receptors and may have a role in the
                  regulation of synaptic transmission. Under
                  pathological conditions, release of an excitatory

                  vulgaris-leucoagglutinin, horseradish peroxidase and
                  fluorescent tracers. Both the core and shell regions
                  project to pallidal areas, i.e. ventral pallidum and
                  entopeduncular nucleus, with a distinct topography
                  in the sense that the core projection is located in
                  the dorsolateral part of ventral pallidum, whereas
                  the shell projects to the medial part of the
                  subcommissural ventral pallidum. Both regions of the
                  accumbens also project to mesencephalon with a bias
                  for the core projection to innervate the substantia
                  nigra-lateral mesencephalic tegmentum, and for the
                  shell projection to reach primarily the ventral
                  tegmental-paramedian tegmentum area. The most
                  pronounced differences between core and shell
                  projections exist in regard to the hypothalamus and
                  extended amygdala. Whereas the core projects
                  primarily to the entopeduncular nucleus including a
                  part that invades the lateral hypothalamus, the
                  shell, in addition, projects diffusely throughout
                  the rostrocaudal extent of the lateral hypothalamus
                  as well as to the extended amygdala, especially its
                  sublenticular part. Both the core and shell of the
                  accumbens have unmistakable striatal characteristics
                  both histologically and in their connectional
                  patterns. The shell, however, has additional
                  features that are reminiscent of the recently
                  described extended amygdala [Alheid G.F. and Heimer

                  in fact, the possibility exists that the shell
                  represents a transitional zone that seems to
                  characterize most of the fringes of the striatal
                  complex, where it adjoins the extended amygdala.}",

                  movements, the basal ganglia control saccadic eye
                  movements (saccades) by means of their connection to
                  the superior colliculus (SC). The SC receives
                  convergent inputs from cerebral cortical areas and
                  the basal ganglia. To make a saccade to an object
                  purposefully, appropriate signals must be selected
                  out of the cortical inputs, in which the basal
                  ganglia play a crucial role. This is done by the
                  sustained inhibitory input from the substantia nigra
                  pars reticulata (SNr) to the SC. This inhibition can
                  be removed by another inhibition from the caudate
                  nucleus (CD) to the SNr, which results in a
                  disinhibition of the SC. The basal ganglia have
                  another mechanism, involving the external segment of
                  the globus pallidus and the subthalamic nucleus,
                  with which the SNr-SC inhibition can further be
                  enhanced. The sensorimotor signals carried by the
                  basal ganglia neurons are strongly modulated
                  depending on the behavioral context, which reflects
                  working memory, expectation, and

                  determinant in that the saccade that has been
                  rewarded is facilitated subsequently. The
                  interaction between cortical and dopaminergic inputs

  abstract =	 "{When exposed to an environment for the first time,
                  rats express greater behavioral activation than rats
                  which were previously habituated to that
                  environment. The circuit containing the ventral
                  tegmental area, nucleus accumbens and ventral
                  pallidum is required for the expression of locomotor
                  activity elicited by amphetamine-like
                  psychostimulants. It was hypothesized that this
                  circuit is necessary for the expression of
                  novelty-induced motor activity. Dopamine is a
                  neurotransmitter in the projection from the ventral
                  tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens, while GABA
                  is contained in the projections from the nucleus
                  accumbens to the ventral pallidum and from the
                  ventral pallidum back to the ventral tegmental
                  area. Prior to exposing rats to a novel or
                  habituated environment, they received a
                  microinjection of either saline vehicle or one of
                  the following drugs: fluphenazine (dopamine
                  antagonist) into the nucleus accumbens, muscimol
                  (GABAA agonist) into the ventral pallidum, or
                  baclofen GABAB agonist) into the ventral tegmental
                  area. Each of these pretreatments prevented
                  novelty-induced motor activation without suppressing
                  the activity of habituated animals. In contrast,
                  when these microinjections were made into adjacent
                  motor nuclei of the basal ganglia, including
                  fluphenazine into the striatum, muscimol into the
                  globus pallidus and baclofen into the substantia
                  nigra, they were ineffective in blocking
                  novelty-induced motor activity. These data indicate
                  that the integrity of the circuit that contains the
                  ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens and

  abstract =	 "{Dopamine (DA) neurons of the substantia nigra (SN)
                  and ventral tegmental area (VTA) respond to a wide
                  category of salient stimuli. Activation of SN and
                  VTA DA neurons, and consequent release of
                  nigrostriatal and mesolimbic DA, modulates the
                  processing of concurrent glutamate inputs to dorsal
                  and ventral striatal target regions. According to
                  the view described here, this occurs under
                  conditions of unexpected environmental change
                  regardless of whether that change is rewarding or
                  aversive. Nigrostriatal and mesolimbic DA activity
                  gates the input of sensory, motor, and incentive
                  motivational (e.g. reward) signals to the
                  striatum. In light of recent single-unit and brain
                  imaging data, it is suggested that the striatal
                  reward signals originate in the orbitofrontal cortex
                  and basolateral amygdala (BLA), regions that project
                  strongly to the striatum. A DA signal of salient
                  unexpected event occurrence, from this framework,
                  gates the throughput of the orbitofrontal glutamate
                  reward input to the striatum just as it gates the
                  throughput of corticostriatal sensory and motor
                  signals needed for normal response
                  execution. Processing of these incoming signals is
                  enhanced when synaptic DA levels are high, because
                  DA enhances the synaptic efficacy of strong
                  concurrent glutamate inputs while reducing the
                  efficacy of weak glutamate inputs. The impairments
                  in motor performance and incentive motivational
                  processes that follow from nigrostriatal and
                  mesolimbic DA loss can be understood in terms of a
                  single mechanism: abnormal processing of
                  sensorimotor and incentive motivation-related
                  glutamate input signals to the striatum.}",

                  antagonist, NBQX (1 and 10 ng), which alone did not
                  produce turning behaviour. The AMPA-induced pivoting

                  D(2) (quinpirole, 10 microg) receptor agonists into
                  the shell has been found to elicit contraversive
                  pivoting. The dopamine D(1)/D(2) receptor
                  antagonist, cis-(Z)-flupentixol (1 and 10 microg),
                  injected into the shell, in doses known to block
                  dopamine D(1)/D(2) receptor-mediated pivoting, also
                  significantly inhibited AMPA (0.5 microg)-induced

                  elicit contraversive pivoting, and that both AMPA

The pivoting induced by a mixture of SKF 38393 (5 microg) and quinpirole (10 microg) injected into the nucleus accumbens shell was significantly inhibited by bicuculline (50 ng) injected into the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, whereas muscimol (25 ng) had no effect. Neither muscimol (25 ng) nor bicuculline (50 ng) modulated the contraversive circling induced by carbachol (5 microg) injected into the nucleus accumbens shell. It is therefore concluded that unilateral stimulation of GABA(A) receptors in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus can elicit contraversive pivoting and that the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus is one of the output stations of the accumbens region that mediates shell-specific, dopaminergic pivoting, but not of the accumbens region that mediates shell-specific, cholinergic circling.}",

                  identical, to that observed during the first period

                  instrumental task-associated spike activity within
                  the NAC is partially dependent upon the presence of
                  the reinforcer, and that encoding across the

                  review will focus on dopamine contribution to
                  synaptic plasticity in different brain areas

  abstract =	 "{A large number of computational models of
                  information processing in the basal ganglia have
                  been developed in recent years. Prominent in these
                  are actor-critic models of basal ganglia
                  functioning, which build on the strong resemblance
                  between dopamine neuron activity and the temporal
                  difference prediction error signal in the critic,
                  and between dopamine-dependent long-term synaptic
                  plasticity in the striatum and learning guided by a
                  prediction error signal in the actor. We selectively
                  review several actor-critic models of the basal
                  ganglia with an emphasis on two important aspects:
                  the way in which models of the critic reproduce the
                  temporal dynamics of dopamine firing, and the extent
                  to which models of the actor take into account known
                  basal ganglia anatomy and physiology. To complement
                  the efforts to relate basal ganglia mechanisms to
                  reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce an
                  alternative approach to modeling a critic network,
                  which uses Evolutionary Computation techniques to
                  'evolve' an optimal RL mechanism, and relate the
                  evolved mechanism to the basic model of the
                  critic. We conclude our discussion of models of the
                  critic by a critical discussion of the anatomical
                  plausibility of implementations of a critic in basal
                  ganglia circuitry, and conclude that such
                  implementations build on assumptions that are
                  inconsistent with the known anatomy of the basal
                  ganglia. We return to the actor component of the
                  actor-critic model, which is usually modeled at the
                  striatal level with very little detail. We describe
                  an alternative model of the basal ganglia which
                  takes into account several important, and previously
                  neglected, anatomical and physiological
                  characteristics of basal ganglia-thalamocortical
                  connectivity and suggests that the basal ganglia
                  performs reinforcement-biased dimensionality
                  reduction of cortical inputs. We further suggest
                  that since such selective encoding may bias the
                  representation at the level of the frontal cortex
                  towards the selection of rewarded plans and actions,
                  the reinforcement-driven dimensionality reduction
                  framework may serve as a basis for basal ganglia
                  actor models. We conclude with a short discussion of

                  organization: a tripartite functional (motor,

                  compartmental (patch/striosome-matrix)

                  projections to the dopaminergic system with respect
                  to their tripartite functional subdivision is also
                  reviewed. This examination indicates that, in rats
                  and primates, the following observations can be
                  made. (1) The limbic striatum reciprocates its
                  dopaminergic input and in addition innervates most
                  of the dopaminergic neurons projecting to the
                  associative and motor striatum, whereas the motor
                  and associative striatum reciprocate only part of
                  their dopaminergic input. Therefore, the connections
                  of the three striatal subregions with the
                  dopaminergic system are asymmetrical, but the
                  direction of asymmetry differs between the limbic
                  versus the motor and associative striatum. (2) The
                  limbic striatum provides the main striatal input to
                  dopamine cell bodies and proximal dendrites, with
                  some contribution from a subset of neurons in the
                  associative and motor striatum (patch neurons in
                  rats; an unspecified group of neurons in primates),
                  while striatal input to the ventrally extending
                  dopamine dendrites arises mainly from a subset of
                  neurons in the associative and motor striatum
                  (matrix neurons in rats; an unspecified group of
                  neurons in primates). (3) Projections from
                  functionally corresponding subdivisions of the
                  striatum, pallidum and subthalamic nucleus to the
                  dopaminergic system overlap, but the specific
                  targets (dopamine cells, dopamine dendrites, GABA
                  cells) of these projections differ. Major
                  differences include the following. (1) In rats,
                  neurons projecting to the motor and associative
                  striatum reside in distinct regions, while in
                  primates they are arranged in interdigitating
                  clusters. (2) In rats, the terminal fields of
                  projections arising from the motor and associative
                  striatum are largely segregated, while in primates
                  they are not. (3) In rats, patch- and
                  matrix-projecting dopamine cells are organized in
                  spatially, morphologically, histochemically and
                  hodologically distinct ventral and dorsal tiers,
                  while in primates there is no (bi)division of the
                  dopaminergic system that results in two areas which
                  have all the characteristics of the two tiers in
                  rats.Based on the anatomical data and known dopamine
                  cell physiology, we forward an hypothesis regarding
                  the influence of the basal ganglia on dopamine cell
                  activity which captures at least part of the complex
                  interplay taking place within the substantia nigra
                  between projections arising from the different basal
                  ganglia nuclei. Finally, we incorporate the striatal
                  connections with the dopaminergic system into an
                  open-interconnected scheme of basal
                  ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry.}",

                  acquisition of a bar-press response for food in
                  hungry rats. This effect was apparent only when
                  infused during the early stages of learning. We have
                  also recently shown that infusion of certain protein
                  kinase inhibitors into the core also impairs
                  learning in the same paradigm. These results suggest
                  that plasticity-related mechanisms within the

                  intracellular second messengers, are important for
                  response-reinforcement learning. In contrast to the
                  core, which primarily connects to somatic motor
                  output systems, the shell is more intimately linked
                  to viscero-endocrine effector systems. We have shown
                  that both AMPA and GABA receptors within the medial
                  shell (but not the core) are critically involved in
                  controlling the brain's feeding pathways, via
                  activation of the lateral hypothalamus (LH). This
                  effect is blocked by local inhibition of the LH in
                  double-cannulae experiments and also strongly and
                  selectively activates Fos expression in the
                  LH. These results provide a newly emerging picture

                  motor behavior and reinforcement. The ventral
                  pallidum receives a direct dopaminergic input from
                  the ventral tegmental area, but also glutamatergic
                  input from cortical and limbic areas. It has been
                  assumed that dopamine release in the VP is indeed
                  modulated by glutamate. The present study
                  investigated the effects of NMDA receptor blockade
                  on motor behavior and dopamine release in the
                  ventral pallidum. In a first experiment, rats were
                  implanted with microdialysis probes in the ventral
                  pallidum and were systemically injected or locally
                  perfused via the microdialysis probe with
                  dizocilpine (0.32 mg/kg, 10 and 100 microM,
                  respectively). Effects on dopamine and on locomotion
                  were simultaneously monitored. In a second
                  experiment, ventral pallidum was lesioned by
                  quinolinic acid and the effects of systemic
                  dizocilpine (0.08 and 0.16 mg/kg) on locomotion and
                  stereotyped sniffing behavior were determined. It
                  was found that systemic and local dizocilpine
                  administration increased dopamine release in the
                  ventral pallidum to a similar extent whereas only
                  systemic treatment was accompanied by locomotor
                  stimulation. Lesion of the ventral pallidum did not
                  affect locomotion and stereotyped sniffing behavior
                  induced by systemic dizocilpine treatment. Thus, DA
                  release in the ventral pallidum that is elevated by
                  blockade of NMDA receptors is not relevant for
                  activation of motor behavior.}",

The accumbens receives afferent input from corticolimbic and thalamic structures, which is primarily coded by excitatory amino acids (EAAs). The present studies investigated the role of EAA input to the nucleus accumbens in feeding behavior in rats, in two recently characterized subregions of the accumbens, the ''core'' and ''shell''. In the first series of experiments, it was shown that blockade of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) and kainate glutamate receptors in the medial part of the accumbens, corresponding to the medial shell subregion, resulted in a pronounced feeding response. Bilateral microinfusion of 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX, 0.25-0.75 micrograms/0.5 microliters), 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline (CNQX, 0.75-1.5 micrograms), and 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoylbenzo-(F) quinoxaline (NBQX, 0.2-1.0 micrograms) markedly stimulated food intake immediately following infusion, in a dose-dependent manner. Infusion of DNQX into the central accumbens region, corresponding to the core, did not elicit feeding. Infusion of the NMDA antagonists 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP-5) and MK-801 (dizocilpine maleate) did not elicit feeding in either region. The feeding response to DNQX was blocked by local coinfusion of AMPA. Systemic pretreatment with naltrexone (5 mg/kg) had no effect on the DNQX-feeding response; however, prior systemic administration of both D-1 and D-2 antagonists reduced the response by half, suggesting a modulatory role for dopamine in the response. Moreover, the feeding response was completely inhibited by concurrent infusion of the GABAA agonist muscimol (10, 25 ng) into the lateral hypothalamus, a major projection area of the accumbens shell. These findings demonstrate a selective role for non-NMDA receptors in the nucleus accumbens shell in ingestive behavior, and suggest an important functional link between two major brain regions involved in reward, the nucleus accumbens and lateral hypothalamus.}",

                  to determine the position of the ventral pallidum in
                  the prefrontal-basal ganglia circuit originating
                  from the prelimbic and medial orbital

                  region of the ventral pallidum. When the biocytin
                  injections were made into this ventral pallidal
                  region, anterogradely labelled fibres were observed

                  not in the mediodorsal nucleus of the
                  thalamus. Confirming these anatomical observations,
                  electrical stimulation of the core of the nucleus
                  accumbens induced an inhibition of the spontaneous
                  activity (D=34.9+/-13.3 ms, L=9.2+/-3.3 ms) in 46.5
                  per cent of the ventral pallidal cells. Among these
                  responding cells, 43 per cent were antidromically

  abstract =	 "{Intracranial self-administration (ICSA) and
                  intracranial place conditioning (ICPC) methodologies
                  have been mainly used to study drug reward
                  mechanisms, but they have also been applied toward
                  examining brain reward mechanisms. ICSA studies in
                  rodents have established that the ventral tegmental
                  area (VTA) is a site supporting morphine and ethanol
                  reinforcement. ICPC studies confirmed that injection
                  of morphine into the VTA produces conditioned place
                  preference (CPP). Further confirmation that
                  activation of opioid receptors within the VTA is
                  reinforcing comes from the findings that the
                  endogenous opioid peptide met-enkephalin injected
                  into the VTA produces CPP, and that the mu- and
                  delta-opioid agonists, DAMGO and DPDPE, are
                  self-infused into the VTA. Activation of the VTA
                  dopamine (DA) system may produce reinforcing effects
                  in general because (a) neurotensin is
                  self-administered into the VTA, and injection of
                  neurotensin into the VTA produces CPP and enhances
                  DA release in the nucleus accumbens (NAC), and (b)
                  GABA(A) antagonists are self-administered into the
                  anterior VTA and injections of GABA(A) antagonists
                  into the anterior VTA enhance DA release in the
                  NAC. The NAC also appears to have a major role in
                  brain reward mechanisms, whereas most data from ICSA
                  and ICPC studies do not support an involvement of
                  the caudate-putamen in reinforcement
                  processes. Rodents will self-infuse a variety of
                  drugs of abuse (e.g. amphetamine, morphine,
                  phencyclidine and cocaine) into the NAC, and this
                  occurs primarily in the shell region. ICPC studies
                  also indicate that injection of amphetamine into the
                  shell portion of the NAC produces CPP. Activation of
                  the DA system within the shell subregion of the NAC
                  appears to play a key role in brain reward
                  mechanisms. Rats will ICSA the DA uptake blocker,
                  nomifensine, into the NAC shell; co-infusion with a
                  D2 antagonist can block this behavior. In addition,
                  rats will self-administer a mixture of a D1 plus a
                  D2 agonist into the shell, but not the core, region
                  of the NAC. The ICSA of this mixture can be blocked
                  with the co-infusion of either a D1 or a D2
                  antagonist. However, the interactions of other
                  transmitter systems within the NAC may also play key
                  roles because NMDA antagonists and the muscarinic
                  agonist carbachol are self-infused into the NAC. The
                  medial prefrontal (MPF) cortex supports the ICSA of
                  cocaine and phencyclidine. The DA system also seems
                  to play a role in this behavior since cocaine
                  self-infusion into the MPF cortex can be blocked by
                  co-infusing a D2 antagonist, or with 6-OHDA lesions
                  of the MPF cortex. Limited studies have been
                  conducted on other CNS regions to elucidate their
                  role in brain and drug reward mechanisms using ICSA
                  or ICPC procedures. Among these regions, ICPC
                  findings suggest that cocaine and amphetamine are
                  rewarding in the rostral ventral pallidum (VP); ICSA
                  and ICPC studies indicate that morphine is rewarding
                  in the dorsal hippocampus, central gray and lateral
                  hypothalamus. Finally, substance P mediated systems
                  within the caudal VP (nucleus basalis
                  magnocellularis) and serotonin systems of the dorsal
                  and median raphe nuclei may also be important
                  anatomical components involved in brain reward
                  mechanisms. Overall, the ICSA and ICPC studies
                  indicate that there are a number of receptors,
                  neuronal pathways, and discrete CNS sites involved
                  in brain reward mechanisms.}",

  title =	 "{Involvement of the amygdala in memory storage:
                  interaction with other brain systems}",
  abstract =	 "{There is extensive evidence that the amygdala is
                  involved in affectively influenced memory. The
                  central hypothesis guiding the research reviewed in
                  this paper is that emotional arousal activates the
                  amygdala and that such activation results in the
                  modulation of memory storage occurring in other
                  brain regions. Several lines of evidence support
                  this view. First, the effects of stress-related
                  hormones (epinephrine and glucocorticoids) are
                  mediated by influences involving the amygdala. In
                  rats, lesions of the amygdala and the stria
                  terminalis block the effects of posttraining
                  administration of epinephrine and glucocorticoids on
                  memory. Furthermore, memory is enhanced by
                  posttraining intraamygdala infusions of drugs that
                  activate beta-adrenergic and glucocorticoid
                  receptors. Additionally, infusion of beta-adrenergic
                  blockers into the amygdala blocks the
                  memory-modulating effects of epinephrine and
                  glucocorticoids, as well as those of drugs affecting
                  opiate and GABAergic systems. Second, an intact
                  amygdala is not required for expression of
                  retention. Inactivation of the amygdala prior to
                  retention testing (by posttraining lesions or drug
                  infusions) does not block retention
                  performance. Third, findings of studies using human
                  subjects are consistent with those of animal
                  experiments. beta-Blockers and amygdala lesions
                  attenuate the effects of emotional arousal on
                  memory. Additionally, 3-week recall of emotional
                  material is highly correlated with positronemission
                  tomography activation (cerebral glucose metabolism)
                  of the right amygdala during encoding. These
                  findings provide strong evidence supporting the
                  hypothesis that the amygdala is involved in
                  modulating long-term memory storage.}",

                  connections, and the connections of their related
                  nuclei. The prefrontal and motor areas consist of a
                  number of modules, which seem to provide multiple
                  subloops of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical
                  connections in subhuman primates. There may be a
                  great degree of convergence of the limbic,
                  associative and motor loops at the level of the
                  striatum, substantia nigra, pallidum, and the
                  subthalamic nucleus as well as the pedunculopontine
                  nucleus. Nigral dopaminergic neurons receive limbic
                  input directly as well as indirectly through the
                  striosomes in the striatum. Dopamine contributes to
                  behavioral learning by signaling motivation and
                  reinforcement. The pedunculopontine nucleus might be
                  involved in behavioral state control, learning and
                  reinforcement processes, locomotion and autonomic
                  functions. Each subdivision of the motor areas
                  receives a mixed and weighted transthalamic input
                  from both the cerebellum and basal ganglia. In
                  particular, based on the author's data, the hand/arm
                  motor area and adjacent premotor area receive strong
                  superficial basal ganglia-thalamocortical
                  projections as well as the deep
                  cerebello-thalamocortical projections. These areas,
                  have very dense corticocotrical connections with
                  other cortical areas, receive polymodal afferents
                  from the parietal and temporal cortices, and
                  integrated information, via multiple routes, from
                  the prefrontal cortex. The author suggests that the
                  ventrolateral part of the caudal medial pallidal

                  it is not clear whether this effect occurs because
                  of a general disruption of food motivation. One way
                  of assessing this has been a choice procedure in
                  which a rat responds on an fixed ratio 5 (FR5)
                  schedule for preferred Bioserve pellets while a less
                  preferred lab chow is concurrently available in the
                  operant chamber. Untreated rats consume little of
                  the chow, preferring to respond for the Bioserve
                  pellets. Previous studies have shown that depleting
                  DA in the accumbens substantially decreased lever
                  pressing while increasing chow consumption. In the
                  present study, low doses (0.0625-1.0 microg) of the
                  D1 antagonist SCH 23390 or the D2 antagonist
                  raclopride were injected into the either the core or
                  shell subregions of nucleus accumbens, and rats were
                  tested on the concurrent lever pressing/feeding
                  task. Analysis of the dose response curves showed
                  that injections of SCH 23390 into the core were more
                  potent than injections into the shell for
                  suppressing lever pressing (i.e., the ED(50) was
                  lower in the core). Nevertheless, injections of
                  either drug into either site suppressed lever
                  pressing and increased intake of the concurrently
                  available chow. Across both drugs and at both sites,
                  the amount of chow consumed was negatively
                  correlated with the total number of
                  responses. Neither drug significantly increased
                  response duration, suggesting that accumbens DA
                  antagonism did not produce the type of motor
                  impairment that leads to severe alterations in the
                  form of lever pressing. In summary, the blockade of
                  D1 or D2 receptors in nucleus accumbens core or
                  shell decreased lever pressing for food reinforcers,
                  but rats remained directed toward the acquisition
                  and consumption of food. These results indicate that
                  accumbens D1 antagonism does not decrease lever
                  pressing because of a general reduction in food
                  motivation. Nevertheless, interference with
                  accumbens DA does appear to set constraints upon
                  which responses are selected for obtaining food, and
                  may impair the ability of animals to overcome

                  spontaneous transitions between two steady-state
                  membrane potentials (average, -77.3 +/- 7.1 mV base,

                  afferents, but not cortical, amygdaloid, or thalamic
                  afferents, induced bistable cells to switch to the

                  accumbens neurons to enter a depolarized, active
                  state. Furthermore, activation of prefrontal

                  of ensembles of neurons rather than by an overall
                  neuronal activation. Indeed, the NA is a site of
                  convergence for a large number of inputs from limbic
                  structures that may modulate the flow of prefrontal
                  cortical information and contribute to defining such
                  ensembles, as exemplified in the ability of
                  hippocampal input to gate cortical throughput in the
                  nucleus accumbens. NA neurons exhibit a bistable
                  membrane potential, characterized by a very negative
                  resting membrane potential (down state),
                  periodically interrupted by plateau depolarizations
                  (up state), during which the cells may fire in
                  response to cortical inputs. A dynamic ensemble can
                  be the result of a distributed set of neurons in
                  their up state, determined by the moment-to-moment
                  changes in the spatial distribution of hippocampal
                  inputs responsible for transitions to the up
                  state. Ensembles may change as an adaptation to the
                  contextual information provided by the hippocampal
                  input. Furthermore, for dynamic ensembles to be
                  functionally relevant, the model calls for near
                  synchronous transitions to the up state in a group
                  of neurons. This can be accomplished by the
                  cell-to-cell transfer of information via gap
                  junctions, a mechanism that can allow for a transfer
                  of slow electrical signals, including''up'' events
                  between coupled cells. Furthermore, gap junction
                  permeability is tightly modulated by a number of
                  factors, including levels of dopamine and nitric
                  oxide, and cortical inputs, allowing for fine-tuning
                  of this synchronization of up events. The continuous
                  selection of such dynamic ensembles in the NA may be

                  food or introducing saline, and all responses were
                  modulated by reversal. These results suggest that
                  the amygdala might be important in ongoing
                  recognition of the affective significance of complex
                  stimuli (food-nonfood discrimination). Second,
                  activity was recorded from 351 neurons in the head
                  of the caudate nucleus of monkeys during an operant
                  feeding task. The 16% of these neurons responded in
                  the discrimination phase. Some of these neurons
                  responded specifically to food. The magnitude of
                  these food-specific neurons depended on the
                  rewarding nature of the food (reward value), and was
                  inversely related to the latency of the onset of bar
                  press. Of the caudate neurons, 10% responded in the
                  bar press phase. Activity of most neurons which
                  responded in the bar press phase was not correlated
                  to individual bar presses. Cooling of the
                  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex abolished sustained
                  responses during bar pressing, but did not abolish
                  the feeding behavior. However, bar press speed
                  tended to be delayed by prefrontal cooling. Third,
                  activity of 358 neurons was recorded from the monkey
                  globus pallidus, and 204 neurons responded during
                  the feeding task. In the globus pallidus, few
                  neurons responded to food in the discrimination
                  phase. On the other hand, activity of most
                  responsive neurons changed during bar press and/or
                  ingestion phases. Activity of about half of these
                  responsive neurons was directly related to specific
                  feeding motor acts such as arm extension, flexion,
                  bar pressing, grasping, chewing, etc. Some of these
                  neurons showed motor-related responses with gradual
                  and preparatory responses. These motor-related
                  neurons were located mainly in the caudodorsal part
                  of the globus pallidus. On the other hand, about one
                  third, especially in the rostroventral part of the
                  globus pallidus, showed dissociating responses in
                  that they responded during bar pressing for food or
                  during ingestion in an operant task, but not during
                  bar pressing for nonfood or during forcible
                  ingestion. The response magnitude of the neurons
                  during arm extension and bar pressing depended on
                  the nature of the food. Fourth, activity of 261
                  neurons was recorded from the substantia nigra pars
                  reticulata. Most of responding neurons (more than
                  two-thirds of the recorded neurons) responded during
                  the bar press and/or ingestion phases. Activity of
                  the one-third of neurons was related to specific
                  motor execution such as arm extension, flexion and
                  bar pressing, but not to motor preparation. These
                  neurons were located mainly in the rostral part of
                  the nucleus. More than one-third of the recorded
                  neurons responded during feeding and/or drinking
                  acts and intra- and perioral sensory stimuli, and
                  were located mainly in the caudomedial part of the
                  nucleus. Based upon these responses and known
                  anatomical evidence, various information including
                  that from the amygdala and prefrontal cortex is
                  integrated in the basal ganglia, and converted to
                  coordinated motivated behaviors such as feeding
                  behavior.}",

                  the complexities of the organization of the

                  (GPe) are classically viewed as part of the
                  so-called indirect pathway, which acts in concert
                  with the direct pathway. The direct and indirect
                  pathways form the conceptual framework of the
                  anatomical and functional organization of the basal
                  ganglia. A review of recent data regarding the
                  connections of the subthalamic nucleus and the GPe
                  has revealed a lack of firm anatomical support for
                  the existence of the indirect pathway. However,
                  newly recognized projections of the subthalamic
                  nucleus and the GPe place these structures on
                  various novel routes that change the conceptual
                  architecture of the basal ganglia circuitry. These
                  new findings force us to modify our view of the
                  functional identity of the subthalamic nucleus and
                  the GPe. In this new perspective, the GPe stands as
                  an additional integrative station, together with the
                  striatum and the internal pallidum and substantia
                  nigra pars reticulata (GPi/SNr), along the main
                  steam of information processing within the basal
                  ganglia circuitry. Because of its crucial position
                  between the input and output stations of the basal
                  ganglia, the GPe can markedly influence the neuronal
                  computation that occurs at GPi/SNr levels. The
                  subthalamic nucleus can still be regarded as a
                  'control structure' lying alongside the main stream
                  of information processing. However, because of its
                  widespread efferent projections, the subthalamic
                  nucleus exerts its driving effect on most components
                  of the basal ganglia. Its action is mediated not
                  only by the indirect pathway, but by a multitude of
                  mono- and polysynaptic projections that ultimately

                  summarized as follows: (i) the dorsal striatum of
                  rat and other myomorph rodents reveals a small
                  caudate equivalent homotopic to the caudate nucleus
                  (C) of other mammals, and a large putamen (Pu). (ii)
                  Shell and core can be distinguished also in the
                  'rostral pole' of nucleus accumbens (ACC) with the
                  calretinin/calbindin and neuropeptide Y (NPY)
                  immunostaining. The shell reveals characteristics of
                  a genuine striatal but not of an extended amygdala
                  (EA) subunit. (iii) EA and lateral septum show
                  striking similarities in structure and fiber
                  connections and may therefore represent a separate
                  parastriatal complex. (iv) The meandering dense
                  layer (DL) of olfactory tubercle (OT) forms
                  longitudinal gyrus- and sulcus-like structures
                  converging in its rostral pole. (v) The core regions
                  of the islands of Calleja that border the ventral
                  pallidum (VP) sharing some of its features are
                  invaded by myelinated fibers of the medial forebrain
                  bundle (MFB). The island of Calleja magna is also
                  apposed to an inconspicuous, slender dorsal
                  appendage of VP. (vi) The VP is composed of a large
                  dorsal reticulated part traversed by the myelinated
                  GABAergic parvalbumin-immunoreactive axons of the
                  MFB and a slender ventral non-reticulate part close
                  to the islands of Calleja. (vii) Considering their
                  close association to the limbic system, ventral
                  striatum (VS) and VP may represent the oldest part
                  of basal ganglia, whereas dorsal striatopallidal
                  subunits were progressively developed in parallel to
                  the growing neocortical influence on motor
                  behavior.}",

  abstract =	 "{The effects of lesions, receptor blocking,
                  electrical self-stimulation, and drugs of abuse
                  suggest that midbrain dopamine systems are involved
                  in processing reward information and learning
                  approach behavior. Most dopamine neurons show phasic
                  activations after primary liquid and food rewards
                  and conditioned, reward-predicting visual and
                  auditory stimuli. They show biphasic,
                  activation-depression responses after stimuli that
                  resemble reward-predicting stimuli or are novel or
                  particularly salient. However, only few phasic
                  activations follow aversive stimuli. Thus dopamine
                  neurons label environmental stimuli with appetitive
                  value, predict and detect rewards and signal
                  alerting and motivating events. By failing to
                  discriminate between different rewards, dopamine
                  neurons appear to emit an alerting message about the
                  surprising presence or absence of rewards. All
                  responses to rewards and reward-predicting stimuli
                  depend on event predictability. Dopamine neurons are
                  activated by rewarding events that are better than
                  predicted, remain uninfluenced by events that are as
                  good as predicted, and are depressed by events that
                  are worse than predicted. By signaling rewards
                  according to a prediction error, dopamine responses
                  have the formal characteristics of a teaching signal
                  postulated by reinforcement learning
                  theories. Dopamine responses transfer during
                  learning from primary rewards to reward-predicting
                  stimuli. This may contribute to neuronal mechanisms
                  underlying the retrograde action of rewards, one of
                  the main puzzles in reinforcement learning. The
                  impulse response releases a short pulse of dopamine
                  onto many dendrites, thus broadcasting a rather
                  global reinforcement signal to postsynaptic
                  neurons. This signal may improve approach behavior
                  by providing advance reward information before the
                  behavior occurs, and may contribute to learning by
                  modifying synaptic transmission. The dopamine reward
                  signal is supplemented by activity in neurons in
                  striatum, frontal cortex, and amygdala, which
                  process specific reward information but do not emit
                  a global reward prediction error signal. A
                  cooperation between the different reward signals may
                  assure the use of specific rewards for selectively
                  reinforcing behaviors. Among the other projection
                  systems, noradrenaline neurons predominantly serve
                  attentional mechanisms and nucleus basalis neurons
                  code rewards heterogeneously. Cerebellar climbing
                  fibers signal errors in motor performance or errors
                  in the prediction of aversive events to cerebellar
                  Purkinje cells. Most deficits following
                  dopamine-depleting lesions are not easily explained
                  by a defective reward signal but may reflect the
                  absence of a general enabling function of tonic
                  levels of extracellular dopamine. Thus dopamine
                  systems may have two functions, the phasic
                  transmission of reward information and the tonic
                  enabling of postsynaptic neurons.}",

                  6, 7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione into the nucleus
                  accumbens shell (AcbSh) elicits pronounced feeding
                  in satiated rats. This glutamate antagonist blocks
                  AMPA and kainate receptors and most likely increases
                  food intake by disrupting a tonic excitatory input
                  to the AcbSh, thus decreasing the firing rate of a
                  population of local neurons. Because the application
                  of GABA agonists also decreases neuronal activity,
                  we hypothesized that administration of GABA agonists
                  into the AcbSh would stimulate feeding in satiated
                  rats. We found that acute inhibition of cells in the

                  agonist muscimol or the GABAB receptor agonist
                  baclofen elicited intense, dose-related feeding
                  without altering water intake. Muscimol-induced
                  feeding was blocked by coadministration of the
                  selective GABAA receptor blocker bicuculline, but
                  not by the GABAB receptor blocker
                  saclofen. Conversely, baclofen-induced feeding was
                  blocked by coadministration of saclofen, but was not
                  affected by bicuculline. Furthermore, we found that
                  increasing local levels of GABA by administration of
                  a selective GABA-transaminase inhibitor,
                  gamma-vinyl-GABA, elicited robust feeding in
                  satiated rats, suggesting a physiological role for
                  endogenous AcbSh GABA in the control of feeding. A
                  mapping study showed that although some feeding can
                  be elicited by muscimol injections near the lateral
                  ventricles, the ventromedial AcbSh is the most
                  sensitive site for eliciting feeding. These findings
                  demonstrate that manipulation of GABA-sensitive
                  cells in the AcbSh can have a pronounced, but
                  specific, effect on feeding behavior in rats. They
                  also constitute the initial description of a novel

  abstract =	 "{This study investigated how the simulated response
                  of dopamine neurons to reward-related stimuli could
                  be used as reinforcement signal for learning a
                  spatial delayed response task. Spatial delayed
                  response tasks assess the functions of frontal
                  cortex and basal ganglia in short-term memory,
                  movement preparation and expectation of
                  environmental events. In these tasks, a stimulus
                  appears for a short period at a particular location,
                  and after a delay the subject moves to the location
                  indicated. Dopamine neurons are activated by
                  unpredicted rewards and reward-predicting stimuli,
                  are not influenced by fully predicted rewards, and
                  are depressed by omitted rewards. Thus, they appear
                  to report an error in the prediction of reward,
                  which is the crucial reinforcement term in formal
                  learning theories. Theoretical studies on
                  reinforcement learning have shown that signals
                  similar to dopamine responses can be used as
                  effective teaching signals for learning. A neural
                  network model implementing the temporal difference
                  algorithm was trained to perform a simulated spatial
                  delayed response task. The reinforcement signal was
                  modeled according to the basic characteristics of
                  dopamine responses to novel stimuli, primary rewards
                  and reward-predicting stimuli. A Critic component
                  analogous to dopamine neurons computed a temporal
                  error in the prediction of reinforcement and emitted
                  this signal to an Actor component which mediated the
                  behavioral output. The spatial delayed response task
                  was learned via two subtasks introducing spatial
                  choices and temporal delays, in the same manner as
                  monkeys in the laboratory. In all three tasks, the
                  reinforcement signal of the Critic developed in a
                  similar manner to the responses of natural dopamine
                  neurons in comparable learning situations, and the
                  learning curves of the Actor replicated the progress
                  of learning observed in the animals. Several
                  manipulations demonstrated further the efficacy of
                  the particular characteristics of the dopamine-like
                  reinforcement signal. Omission of reward induced a
                  phasic reduction of the reinforcement signal at the
                  time of the reward and led to extinction of learned
                  actions. A reinforcement signal without prediction
                  error resulted in impaired learning because of
                  perseverative errors. Loss of learned behavior was
                  seen with sustained reductions of the reinforcement
                  signal, a situation in general comparable to the
                  loss of dopamine innervation in Parkinsonian
                  patients and experimentally lesioned animals. The
                  striking similarities in teaching signals and
                  learning behavior between the computational and
                  biological results suggest that dopamine-like reward
                  responses may serve as effective teaching signals
                  for learning behavioral tasks that are typical for

  abstract =	 "{To understand how hippocampal signals are processed
                  by downstream neurons, we analyzed the relative
                  timing between neuronal discharges in simultaneous
                  recordings in the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens
                  of rats performing in a plus maze. In all, 154 pairs
                  of cells (composed of 65 hippocampal and 56
                  accumbens neurons) were examined during the 1 s
                  period prior to reward delivery. Cross-correlation
                  analyses over a +/- 300-ms window with 10-ms bins
                  revealed that 108 pairs had at least one significant
                  histogram bin (P < 0.01). The most frequently
                  occurring peaks of hippocampal firing prior to
                  accumbens discharges appeared at latencies from
                  -30-0 ms, corresponding to published values of the
                  latency of the hippocampal pathway to the nucleus
                  accumbens. Other peaks appeared most often at
                  latencies multiples of about 110 ms prior to and
                  after this, corresponding to theta
                  rhythmicity. Since firing synchronization can result
                  from several types of connectivity patterns (such as
                  common inputs), a group of 18 hippocampus-accumbens
                  pairs was selected as those most likely to have
                  monosynaptic connections. The criterion was the
                  presence of at least one highly significant peak (P
                  < 0.001) at latencies corresponding to field
                  potentials evoked in the accumbens by hippocampal
                  stimulation. A significant peak occurred on all four
                  maze arms for only one of these cell pairs,
                  indicating positional modulation for the others. In
                  addition, behavior dependence of the synchrony
                  between these nucleus accumbens and hippocampus
                  neurons was examined by studying data in relation to
                  three different synchronization points: reward box
                  arrival, box departure, and arrival at the center of
                  the maze. This indicates that the functional
                  connectivity between hippocampal and accumbens
                  neurons was stronger when the rat was near reward
                  areas. Ten of the hippocampal neurons in these 18
                  cell pairs showed 9-Hz (theta) rhythmic activity in
                  autocorrelation analyses. Of these 10 cells,
                  cross-correlograms from eight hippocampal-accumbens
                  pairs also showed theta rhythmicity. Overall, these
                  results indicate that the synchrony between
                  hippocampus and nucleus accumbens neurons is
                  modulated by spatial position and behavior, and
                  theta rhythm may play an important role for this

                  the basal ganglia such as Parkinson's
                  disease. Excitatory synapses in striatum undergo a
                  form of developmental plasticity characterized by a
                  decrease in glutamate release probability. Here we
                  demonstrate that this form of synaptic plasticity is
                  DA and DA D2 receptor dependent. Analysis of
                  spontaneous synaptic responses indicates that a
                  presynaptic mechanism involving inhibition of
                  neurotransmitter release underlies the developmental
                  plasticity. We suggest that a major role of DA in
                  the striatum is to initiate mechanisms that regulate
                  the efficacy of excitatory striatal synapses,
                  producing a decrease in glutamate release.}",

To help characterize the contribution of the LH to the expression of AcbSh-mediated feeding, we used the immunohistochemical detection of the nuclear protein Fos to determine whether inhibition of AcbSh cells results in an activation of LH neurons. Injections of the GABA(A) agonist muscimol into the AcbSh greatly increased the number of cells exhibiting Fos-like immunoreactivity in the LH, as well as in the lateral septum, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra pars compacta, and nucleus of the solitary tract. Blocking activation of LH neurons with the selective NMDA receptor blocker D(-)-AP-5 is known to suppress deprivation-induced feeding. We found that injections of D(-)-AP5 into the LH also dose-dependently suppressed AcbSh-mediated feeding. It is likely that inhibition of GABAergic neurons in the AcbSh is responsible for eliciting this feeding. If a behaviorally relevant GABAergic projection terminates in the LH, we should be able to mimic the effects seen after inhibition of the projection neurons by applying a GABA receptor blocker to the area. However, injections of the GABA(A) receptor blocker bicuculline or the GABA(B) receptor blocker saclofen did not significantly affect food intake. Thus, it appears that the expression of the feeding response depends on an NMDA-preferring receptor-mediated activation of LH neurons and is not the result of disinhibiting LH cells by disrupting transmission at GABA synapses.}",

            of hypothalamic neurons receiving input from the AcbSh, we
            carried out c-Fos/peptide double-labeling
            immunohistochemistry in various hypothalamic areas known
            to contain feeding peptides, from rats that exhibited a
            significant feeding response after AcbSh microinjection of
            the GABA(A) agonist muscimol. In the perifornical area, a
            significantly higher percentage of orexin neurons
            expressed Fos after muscimol compared with saline
            injection. In contrast, Fos expression was not induced in
            melanin-concentrating hormone and
            cocaine-amphetamine-related transcript (CART) neurons. In
            the arcuate nucleus, Fos activation was significantly
            lower in neurons coexpressing CART and
            proopiomelanocortin, and there was a tendency for higher
            Fos expression in neuropeptide Y neurons. In the
            paraventricular nucleus, no significant activation of
            oxytocin and CART neurons was found. Thus AcbSh
            manipulation may elicit food intake through coordinated
            stimulation of hypothalamic neurons expressing orexigenic
            peptides and suppression of neurons expressing
            anorexigenic peptides. However, activation of many neurons
            not expressing these peptides suggests that additional
            peptides/transmitters in the lateral hypothalamus and
            accumbens projections to other brain areas might also be
            involved.}",

abstract = "{Our previous studies have shown that stimulation of
            mu-opioid receptors within the nucleus accumbens
            preferentially enhances intake of palatable food
            containing sucrose and fat; thus, opioids in this brain
            area may mediate the rewarding characteristics of food by
            modulating taste and macronutrient preference. The present
            study was designed to further explore the nature of the
            involvement of striatal opioids in feeding behavior, such
            as the location of sensitive subregions of the ventral
            striatum and the brain neural circuits involved in
            opioid-mediated hyperphagia. In Experiment 1, we conducted
            a microinfusion mapping study of feeding behavior by
            microinfusion of the mu receptor agonist,
            D-Ala(2),NMe-Phe(4), Glyol(5)-enkephalin (0, 0.025 and
            0.25 microg/0.5 microl per side; equivalent to 0, 0.04 and
            0.40 nmol/0.5 microl per side), into several striatal
            subregions. In Experiment 2, detection of the expression
            of the immediate early gene, c-fos, was used to examine
            brain areas activated following intra-striatal
            microinfusion of D-Ala(2),

            study demonstrated a broad anatomical gradient within the

            lateral and ventral regions of the striatum (ventrolateral
            striatum, lateral shell and core). The Fos mapping study
            demonstrated that circuitry including hypothalamic areas,
            the ventral tegmental area, the substantia nigra and the
            nucleus of the solitary tract was recruited by stimulation
            of mu receptors within the nucleus accumbens. A similar
            pattern was observed following stimulation of mu receptors
            in the dorsal striatum; however, the extent of activation
            was much smaller in magnitude. These results suggest that
            the role of mu receptors within the striatum in palatable
            feeding primarily involves ventral and lateral
            regions. Moreover, the pattern of activation in
            hypothalamic, midbrain and gustatory-visceral relay areas

abstract = "{There is a long-standing interest in the role of
            endogenous opioid peptides in feeding behavior and, in
            particular, in the modulation of food reward and
            palatability. Since drugs such as heroin, morphine,
            alcohol, and cannabinoids, interact with this system,
            there may be important common neural substrates between
            food and drug reward with regard to the brain's opioid
            systems. In this paper, we review the proposed functional
            role of opioid neurotransmission and mu opiate receptors
            within the nucleus accumbens and surrounding ventral
            striatum. Opioid compounds, particularly those selective
            for the mu receptor, induce a potent increase in food
            intake, sucrose, salt, saccharin, and ethanol intake. We
            have explored this phenomenon with regard to macronutrient
            selection, regional specificity, role of output
            structures, Fos mapping, analysis of motivational state,
            and enkephalin gene expression. We hypothesize that
            opioid-mediated mechanisms within ventral striatal medium
            spiny neurons mediate the affective or hedonic response to
            food ('liking' or food 'pleasure'). A further refinement
            of this hypothesis is that activation of ventral striatal
            opioids specifically encodes positive affect induced by
            tasty and/or calorically dense foods (such as sugar and
            fat), and promotes behaviors associated with this enhanced
            palatability. It is proposed that this brain mechanism was
            beneficial in evolutionary development for ensuring the
            consumption of relatively scarce, high-energy food
            sources. However, in modern times, with unlimited supplies

abstract = "{What are the neutral substrates of food reward? Are
            reward and pleasure identical? Can taste pleasure be
            assessed in animals? Is reward necessarily conscious?
            These questions have re-emerged in recent years, and there
            is now sufficient evidence to prompt re-examination of
            many preconceptions concerning reward and its relation to
            brain systems. This paper reviews evidence from many
            sources regarding both the psychological structure of food
            reward and the neutral systems that mediate it. Special
            attention is paid to recent evidence from "tasty
            reactivity" studies of affective reactions to food. I
            argue that this evidence suggests the following surprising
            possibilities regarding the functional components and
            brain substrates of food reward. (1) Reward contains
            distinguishable psychological or functional
            components--"liking" (pleasure/palatability) and "wanting"
            (appetite/incentive motivation). These can be manipulated
            and measured separately. (2) Liking and wanting have
            separable neutral substrates. Mediation of liking related
            to food reward involves neurotransmitter systems such as
            opioid and GABA/benzodiazepine systems, and anatomical
            structures such as ventral pallidum and brainstem primary
            gustatory relays. Mediation of wanting related to food
            reward involves mesotelencephalic dopamine systems, and
            divisions of nucleus accumbens and amygdala. Both liking
            and wanting arise from vastly distributed neutral systems,
            but the two systems are separable. (3) Neutral processing
            of food reward is not confined to the limbic
            forebrain. Aspects of food reward begin to be processed in
            the brainstem. A neutral manipulation can enhance reward
            or produce aversion but no single lesion or transection is
            likely abolish all properties of food reward. (4) Both
            wanting and liking can exist without subjective
            awareness. Conscious experience can distort or blur the
            underlying reward process that gave rise to it. Subjective
            reports may contain false assessments of underlying
            processes, or even fail at all to register important
            reward processes. The core processes of liking and wanting
            that constitute reward are distinct from the subjective
            report or conscious awareness of those processes.}",

            dopamine in the modulation of motivated behaviors, there
            have been no studies directly comparing the effects of
            acute dopamine receptor blockade in the Acb core versus

            bilaterally into the Acb core or shell of hungry rats,
            whereupon feeding, drinking, and spontaneous motor
            activity were monitored. Both the D1 antagonist SCH 23390
            (0, 1, and 2 microg/0.5 microl) and the D2 antagonist
            raclopride (0, 1, and 2 microg/0.5 microl) markedly
            suppressed ambulation and rearing when infused into either
            the Acb core or shell. Total food intake and latency to
            begin feeding were unaffected by either drug in either
            site. SCH 23390 in the Acb shell, and raclopride in the
            Acb core or shell, significantly decreased the total
            number of feeding bouts. In the Acb core, raclopride
            produced a small but statistically significant increase in
            overall feeding duration. Dopamine receptor blockade in
            either site tended to increase mean feeding bout
            duration. Measures of drinking behavior were generally
            unaffected. Hence, dopamine receptor blockade in either
            the Acb core or shell of hungry rats suppressed
            spontaneous motor activity and shifted the structure of
            feeding towards longer bout durations, but did not alter
            the total amount of food consumed. In the Acb shell, the
            effects of D1 receptor blockade tended to be of greater
            magnitude than the effects of D2 receptor blockade,
            although major differences between core and shell effects
            were not observed. These results are discussed with regard

title = "{Response-reinforcement learning is dependent on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation in the nucleus accumbens core}",

abstract = "{The nucleus accumbens, a site within the ventral
            striatum, is best known for its prominent role in
            mediating the reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse such
            as cocaine, alcohol, and nicotine. Indeed, it is generally
            believed that this structure subserves motivated
            behaviors, such as feeding, drinking, sexual behavior, and
            exploratory locomotion, which are elicited by natural
            rewards or incentive stimuli. A basic rule of positive
            reinforcement is that motor responses will increase in
            magnitude and vigor if followed by a rewarding event. It
            is likely, therefore, that the nucleus accumbens may serve
            as a substrate for reinforcement learning. However, there
            is surprisingly little information concerning the neural
            mechanisms by which appetitive responses are learned. In
            the present study, we report that treatment of the nucleus
            accumbens core with the selective competitive
            N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist
            2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP-5; 5 nmol/0.5 microl
            bilaterally) impairs response-reinforcement learning in
            the acquisition of a simple lever-press task to obtain
            food. Once the rats learned the task, AP-5 had no effect,
            demonstrating the requirement of NMDA receptor-dependent
            plasticity in the early stages of learning. Infusion of
            AP-5 into the accumbens shell produced a much smaller
            impairment of learning. Additional experiments showed that
            AP-5 core-treated rats had normal feeding and locomotor
            responses and were capable of acquiring stimulus-reward
            associations. We hypothesize that stimulation of NMDA
            receptors within the accumbens core is a key process
            through which motor responses become established in
            response to reinforcing stimuli. Further, this mechanism,
            may also play a critical role in the motivational and
            addictive properties of drugs of abuse.}",

abstract = "{At least two temporally and mechanistically distinct forms of memory are conserved across many species: short-term memory that persists minutes to hours after training and long-term memory (LTM) that persists days or longer. In general, repeated training trials presented with intervening rest intervals (spaced training) is more effective than massed training (the same number of training trials presented with no or short intervening rest intervals) in producing LTM. LTM requires de novo protein synthesis, and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) may be one of the transcription factors regulating the synthesis of new proteins necessary for the formation of LTM. Here we show that rats given massed fear conditioning training show no or weak LTM, as measured by fear-potentiated startle, compared with rats given the same amount of training but presented in a spaced manner. Increasing CREB levels specifically in the basolateral amygdala via viral vector-mediated gene transfer significantly increases LTM after massed fear training. The enhancing effect of CREB overexpression on LTM formation is shown to be specific in terms of biochemistry, anatomy, time course, and the training procedure used. These results suggest that CREB activity in the amygdala serves as a molecular switch for the formation of LTM in fear conditioning.}",

abstract = "{The present study demonstrates that chronic, but not acute, adminstration of several different classes of antidepressants, including serotonin- and norepinephrine-selective reuptake inhibitors, increases the expression of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) mRNA in rat hippocampus. In contrast, chronic administration of several nonantidepressant psychotropic drugs did not influence expression of CREB mRNA, demonstrating the pharmacological specificity of this effect. In situ hybridization analysis demonstrates that antidepressant administration increases expression of CREB mRNA in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal and dentate gyrus granule cell layers of the hippocampus. In addition, levels of CRE immunoreactivity and of CRE binding activity were increased by chronic antidepressant administration, which indicates that expression and function of CREB protein are increased along with its mRNA. Chronic administration of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors rolipram or papaverine also increased expression of CREB mRNA in hippocampus, demonstrating a role for the cAMP cascade. Moreover, coadministration of rolipram with imipramine resulted in a more rapid induction of CREB than with either treatment alone. Increased expression and function of CREB suggest that specific target genes may be regulated by these treatments. We have found that levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and trkB mRNA are also increased by administration of antidepressants or PDE inhibitors. These findings indicate that upregulation of CREB is a common action of chronic antidepressant treatments that may lead to regulation of specific target genes, such as BDNF and trkB, and to the long-term effects of these treatments on brain function.}",

abstract = "{Previous studies have shown that chronic morphine increases levels of the G-protein subunits Gia and Goa, adenylate cyclase, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, and certain phosphoproteins in the rat locus coeruleus, but not in several other brain regions studied, and that chronic morphine decreases levels of Gia and increases levels of adenylate cyclase in dorsal root ganglion/spinal cord (DRG-SC) co-cultures. These findings led us to survey the effects of chronic morphine on the G-protein/cyclic AMP system in a large number of brain regions to determine how widespread such regulation might be. We found that while most regions showed no regulation in response to chronic morphine, nucleus accumbens (NAc) and amygdala did show increases in adenylate cyclase and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity, and thalamus showed an increase in cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity only. An increase in cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity was also observed in DRG-SC co-cultures. Morphine regulation of G-proteins was variable, with decreased levels of Gia seen in the NAc, increased levels of Gia and Goa in amygdala, and no change in thalamus or the other brain regions studied. Interestingly, chronic treatment of rats with cocaine, but not with several non-abused drugs, produced similar changes compared to morphine in G-proteins, adenylate cyclase, and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase in the NAc, but not in the other brain regions studied. These results indicate that regulation of the G-protein/cyclic AMP system represents a mechanism by which a number of opiate-sensitive neurons adapt to chronic morphine and thereby develop aspects of opiate tolerance and/or dependence. The findings that chronic morphine and cocaine produce similar adaptations in the NAc, a brain region important for the reinforcing actions of many types of abused substances, suggest further that common mechanisms may underlie psychological aspects of drug addiction mediated by this brain region.}",

It has recently been demonstrated that amphetamine regulates the expression of several genes, including c-fos, via dopamine D1 receptors in rat striatum. Here we report that amphetamine induces phosphorylation of transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) in rat striatum in vivo and that dopamine D1 receptor stimulation induces phosphorylation of CREB within specific complexes bound to cAMP regulatory elements. In addition, we show by antisense injection that CREB is necessary for c-fos induction by amphetamine in vivo. Since CREB has been implicated in the activation of a number of immediate-early genes as well as several neuropeptide genes, CREB phosphorylation may be an important early nuclear event mediating long-term consequences of amphetamine administration.}",

Treatment with d-amphetamine (5 mg/kg) for 5 consecutive days produced behavioral sensitization. Similar to previous observations using chronic cocaine administration, amphetamine sensitized animals had decreased c-Fos and increased FRA proteins in striatum. Supershift analysis with antisera to c-Fos and FRA proteins demonstrated that 4-Fos and the 35 kDa FRA are components of the striatal AP-1 binding complex from sensitized rats. Thus, amphetamine sensitization is accompanied by alterations in the composition of the AP-1 DNA binding complex. An increased amount of phosphoCREB protein was also present in the striatum of amphetamine sensitized rats. These results suggest that alterations in Fos, FRA and CREB transcription factors are common neuronal responses to chronic psychostimulant administration and may contribute to regulation of genes important to the neuroplastic changes underlying psychostimulant sensitization.}",

Conversely, overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant CREB increases the rewarding effects of cocaine. Altered transcription of dynorphin likely contributes to these effects: Its expression is increased by overexpression of CREB and decreased by overexpression of mutant CREB.

abstract = "{Drugs of abuse regulate the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) in striatal regions, including the nucleus accumbens (NAc). To explore how regulation of CREB in the NAc affects behavior, we used herpes simplex virus (HSV) vectors to elevate CREB expression in this region or to overexpress a dominant-negative mutant CREB (mCREB) that blocks CREB function. Rats treated with HSV-mCREB in place conditioning studies spent more time in environments associated with cocaine, indicating increased cocaine reward. Conversely, rats treated with HSV-CREB spent less time in cocaine-associated environments, indicating increased cocaine aversion. Studies in which drug-environment pairings were varied to coincide with either the early or late effects of cocaine suggest that CREB-associated place aversions reflect increased cocaine withdrawal. Because cocaine withdrawal can be accompanied by symptoms of depression, we examined how altered CREB function in the NAc affects behavior in the forced swim test (FST). Elevated CREB expression increased immobility in the FST, an effect that is opposite to that caused by standard antidepressants and is consistent with a link between CREB and dysphoria. Conversely, overexpression of mCREB decreased immobility, an effect similar to that caused by antidepressants. Moreover, the kappa opioid receptor antagonist nor-Binaltorphimine decreased immobility in HSV-CREB- and HSV-mCREB-treated rats, suggesting that CREB-mediated induction of dynorphin (an endogenous kappa receptor ligand) contributes to immobility behavior in the FST. Exposure to the FST itself dramatically increased CREB function in the NAc. These findings raise the possibility that CREB-mediated transcription within the NAc regulates dysphoric states.}",

abstract = "{Chronic opiate exposure is associated with upregulation
of the cAMP signaling pathway and the transcription factor cAMP
response element-binding protein in the locus ceruleus (LC) and
certain other brain areas. To determine whether these adaptations
ultimately affect transcription mediated by the cAMP response element
(CRE), we induced morphine dependence in CRE-LacZ transgenic mice and
performed a regional and cellular mapping of beta-galactosidase
(beta-gal) expression during naltrexone-precipitated
withdrawal. Consistent with our model of opiate dependence, beta-gal
expression increased in the LC, but decreased in the lateral ventral
tegmental area (VTA) and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). In addition,
withdrawal increased beta-gal expression in the continuum of the
extended amygdala and nucleus accumbens, macrostructures associated
with the coupling of emotional stimuli to motor and autonomic
responses. At the cellular level, in the central nucleus of the
amygdala, beta-gal was found in cells both with and without mu opioid
receptors as well as in corticotropin-releasing factor-expressing
cells. In nucleus accumbens, beta-gal was expressed in several major
subpopulations of neurons. In LC, beta-gal expression was induced
predominantly in tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing cells, whereas in the
VTA and DRN the majority of cells expressing beta-gal were
nonmonoaminergic. These results show that molecular adaptations to
chronic morphine alter CRE-mediated transcription during opiate
withdrawal in physiologically salient regions involved in arousal,
reward, mood, and affective responses. We propose that CRE-mediated
transcription serves as a functional marker for neuronal plasticity
during withdrawal. CRE-mediated transcription may itself contribute to
re-establishing homeostasis in the organism through target gene

abstract = "{cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) has been implicated in cocaine addiction because (1) cocaine reinforcement is mediated by dopamine receptors that modulate cAMP formation, and (2) repeated exposure to cocaine upregulates the cAMP system in NAc neurons. This study tested PKA involvement in cocaine self-administration and relapse of cocaine-seeking behavior by infusing cAMP analogs that activate or inhibit PKA into the NAc of rats. Bilateral intra-NAc infusions of the PKA inhibitor Rp-cAMPS reduced baseline cocaine self-administration, shifted the dose-response curve for cocaine self-administration to the left, and induced relapse of cocaine-seeking behavior after extinction from cocaine self-administration, consistent with an enhancement of cocaine effects in each paradigm. In contrast, pretreatment with intra-NAc infusions of a PKA activator, Sp-cAMPS or dibutyryl cAMP, increased baseline cocaine self-administration during the second hour of testing and shifted the dose-response curve to the right, consistent with an antagonist-like action. After extinction from cocaine self-administration, similar infusions of Sp-cAMPS induced generalized responding at both drug-paired and inactive levers. As an index of PKA activity in vivo, NAc infusions of Rp-cAMPS reduced basal levels of dopamine-regulated phosphoprotein-32 phosphorylation and blocked amphetamine-induced increases in cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation. Conversely, NAc infusions of Sp-cAMPS increased phosphorylation of CREB. Together, these results suggest that sustained upregulation of the cAMP system in the NAc after repeated cocaine exposure could underlie tolerance to cocaine reinforcement, whereas acute inhibition of this system may contribute to drug craving and relapse in addicted subjects.}",

abstract = "{It is commonly believed that repeated exposures diminish the pleasurable effects of drugs and hence that pleasure must have only a minor role in addiction. In six experiments with rats, repeated exposures to amphetamine, morphine, or cocaine were found to enhance the drug-induced rewarding effect as measured by conditioned place preference. Thus, sensitization to the rewarding effect, rather than tolerance, was obtained. Also, cross-sensitization was obtained; exposures to amphetamine enhanced the rewarding effect of morphine and vice versa; similarly, exposures to morphine enhanced the rewarding effect of cocaine. These findings support a new theory: drugs of abuse are addictive because repeated exposures sensitize the central reward mechanism so that drug taking produces a progressively greater reinforcing effect each time it occurs.}",

title = "{The neural basis of drug craving: an incentive-sensitization theory of addiction}",
abstract = "{This paper presents a biopsychological theory of drug addiction, the 'Incentive-Sensitization Theory'. The theory addresses three fundamental questions. The first is: why do addicts crave drugs? That is, what is the psychological and neurobiological basis of drug craving? The second is: why does drug craving persist even after long periods of abstinence? The third is whether 'wanting' drugs (drug craving) is attributable to 'liking' drugs (to the subjective pleasurable effects of drugs)? The theory posits the following. (1) Addictive drugs share the ability to enhance mesotelencephalic dopamine neurotransmission. (2) One psychological function of this neural system is to attribute 'incentive salience' to the perception and mental representation of events associated with activation of the system. Incentive salience is a psychological process that transforms the perception of stimuli, imbuing them with salience, making them attractive, 'wanted', incentive stimuli. (3) In some individuals the repeated use of addictive drugs produces incremental neuroadaptations in this neural system, rendering it increasingly and perhaps permanently, hypersensitive ('sensitized') to drugs and drug-associated stimuli. The sensitization of dopamine systems is gated by associative learning, which causes excessive incentive salience to be attributed to the act of drug taking and to stimuli associated with drug taking. It is specifically the sensitization of incentive salience, therefore, that transforms ordinary 'wanting' into excessive drug craving. (4) It is further proposed that sensitization of the neural systems responsible for incentive salience ('for wanting') can occur independently of changes in neural systems that mediate the subjective pleasurable effects of drugs (drug 'liking') and of neural systems that mediate withdrawal. Thus, sensitization of incentive salience can produce addictive behavior (compulsive drug seeking and drug taking) even if the expectation of drug pleasure or the aversive properties of withdrawal are diminished and even in the face of strong disincentives, including the loss of reputation, job, home and family. We review evidence for this view of addiction and discuss its implications for understanding the psychology and neurobiology of addiction.}",

In order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of how afferents are distributed relative to these subterritories, immunohistochemical detection of retrogradely transported Fluoro-Gold was carried out following iontophoretic injections intended to involve selectively one of the subterritories. The data revealed that a number of cortical afferents of the medial shell and core originate in separate areas, i.e., the dorsal peduncular, infralimbic, and posterior piriform cortices (to medial shell) and the dorsal prelimbic, anterior agranular insular, anterior cingulate, and perirhinal cortices (to core). The lateral shell and rostral pole are innervated by cortical structures that also project either to the medial shell or core. The orbital, posterior agranular insular, and entorhinal cortices, hippocampus, and basal amygdala were observed to innervate the accumbens in a topographic manner. Following core injections, strong bilateral cortical labeling was observed. Few labeled cortical cells were observed contralaterally following injections in the medial shell. Intermediate numbers of labeled neurons were observed in contralateral cortices following lateral shell injections. Robust subcortical labeling in a variety of structures in the ventral forebrain, lateral hypothalamus, deep temporal lobe, and brainstem was observed after shell injections, particularly those that involved the caudal dorsomedial extremity of the shell, i.e., its "septal pole." Selective ipsilateral labeling of subcortical structures in the basal ganglia circuitry was observed following injections in the core and, to a lesser extent, lateral shell. It was concluded that a number of afferent systems exhibit varying degrees of segregation with respect to the accumbal subterritories.}",

Studies in patients with posttraumatic stress syndrome indicate these individuals seem to show normal fear reactions but abnormal anxiety measured with the acoustic startle reflex. Studies in rats, also using the startle reflex, indicate that highly processed explicit cue information (lights, tones, touch) activates the central nucleus of the amygdala, which in turn activates hypothalamic and brain stem target areas involved in specific signs of fear. Somewhat less explicit information, such as that produced by exposure to a threating environment for several minutes or by intraventricular administration of the peptide corticotropin-releasing hormone may activate a brain area closely related to the amygdala, called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, which in turn activates hypothalamic and brain stem target areas involved in specific signs of fear or anxiety. Because the nature of this information may be less specific than that produced by an explicit cue, and of much longer duration, activation of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis may be more akin to anxiety than to fear.}",

abstract = "{We tested the hypothesis that noxious stimuli induce pain modulation by activation of supraspinal structures. We found that intense noxious stimuli (i.e., subdermal injection of capsaicin or paw immersion in hot water) induced profound attenuation of the jaw-opening reflex in the anesthetized rat; forepaw subdermal capsaicin also elevated the mechanical hindpaw-withdrawal threshold in the awake rat. These antinociceptive effects were blocked by previous injection of either a dopamine antagonist (flupentixol) or an opioid antagonist (naloxone) into the nucleus accumbens. Additional experiments in anesthetized animals showed that the antinociceptive effect of noxious stimulation by either capsaicin (>/=100 micrograms) or hindpaw immersion in hot water (>/=45 degrees C for 4 min) correlated with the intensity of the stimulus. The maximal antinociceptive effect of capsaicin was similar in magnitude to that of a high dose of morphine (10 mg/kg) injected subcutaneously. Injection of the GABA(A)-receptor agonist muscimol, but not naloxone, into the rostroventral medulla, a major component of descending pain modulation systems, blocked capsaicin-induced antinociception. Although it is widely thought that painful stimuli may induce analgesia by activating forebrain structures, this is the first demonstration that such a mechanism exists. Furthermore, this mechanism can be engaged by naturalistic stimuli in awake animals. These observations imply that painful stimuli might under certain conditions be rewarding.}",

Little is known, however, about the neural systems underlying the suppression of tonic pain except that they are different from those mediating the suppression of phasic (i.e., sharp and short-lasting) pain. Although spinal and brainstem-descending pain suppression mechanisms play a role in mediating the inhibition of tonic pain, it appears that this response is additionally mediated by the activation of mechanisms lying rostral to the brainstem. Recent studies suggest that the activation of mesolimbic dopamine (DA) neurons, arising from the cell bodies of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), plays an important role in mediating the suppression of tonic pain. Other studies suggest that this pain-suppression system involving the activation of mesolimbic DA neurons is naturally triggered by exposure to stress, through the endogenous release of opioids and substance P (SP) in the midbrain.}",

abstract = "{This paper reviews recent developments in the neurocircuitry and neurobiology of addiction from a perspective of allostasis. A model is proposed for brain changes that occur during the development of addiction that explain the persistent vulnerability to relapse long after drug-taking has ceased. Addiction is presented as a cycle of spiralling dysregulation of brain reward systems that progressively increases, resulting in the compulsive use and loss of control over drug-taking. The development of addiction recruits different sources of reinforcement, different neuroadaptive mechanisms, and different neurochemical changes to dysregulate the brain reward system. Counteradaptive processes such as opponent-process that are part of normal homeostatic limitation of reward function fail to return within the normal homeostatic range and are hypothesized to form an allostatic state. Allostasis from the addiction perspective is defined as the process of maintaining apparent reward function stability by changes in brain reward mechanisms. The allostatic state represents a chronic deviation of reward set point and is fueled not only by dysregulation of reward circuits per se, but also by the activation of brain and hormonal stress responses. The manifestation of this allostatic state as compulsive drug-taking and loss of control over drug-taking is hypothesized to be expressed through activation of brain circuits involved in compulsive behavior such as the cortico-striatal-thalamic loop. The view that addiction is the pathology that results from an allostatic mechanism using the circuits established for natural rewards provides a realistic approach to identifying the neurobiological factors that produce vulnerability to addiction and relapse.}",

In this report we show, by means of in vivo microdialysis and Fos immunohistochemistry, that the hyper-responsiveness which characterizes the dopaminergic transmission to the shell is dependent on glucocorticoid hormones. In Sprague-Dawley rats, after suppression of endogenous glucocorticoids by adrenalectomy, extracellular dopamine levels selectively decreased in the shell, whilst they remained unchanged in the core. This effect was observed in basal conditions, after a mild stress (vehicle injection), as well as after subcutaneous administration of morphine (2 mg/kg, s.c. ) or intraperitoneal injection of cocaine (15 mg/kg, i.p.). The decrease in dopamine observed in the shell had a postsynaptic impact, as shown by less induction of Fos-like proteins selectively in the shell in response to cocaine. However, the induction of Fos-like proteins by the full D1 agonist SKF82958 (1.5 mg/kg, i.p.) remained unchanged after adrenalectomy, suggesting that the changes in Fos expression after cocaine injection were likely to depend on changes in extracellular dopamine levels rather than on changes in postsynaptic sensitivity to dopamine. The effects of adrenalectomy were glucocorticoid-specific given that they were prevented by corticosterone treatment. This anatomical specificity in the control of neuronal activity by a hormonal input highlights the role of steroid hormones in shaping the functional activity of the brain.}",

In this study we compared the responses of these three regions to mild stress and drugs of abuse by measuring extracellular dopamine (DA) concentrations and Fos-like immunoreactivity (Fos-LI). The results are summarrized as follows. (i) In unchallenged conditions, extracellular DA concentrations were highest in the dorsolateral striatum and lowest in the core, whereas Fos-LI was highest in the shell and lowest in the dorsolateral striatum. (ii) After challenges that increase DA by depolarizing DAergic neurons (injection stress or 2 mg/kg morphine), the shell presented the largest increase in DA levels and Fos-LI. (iii) After the administration of a DA-uptake blocker (15 mg/kg cocaine), the percentage increase in DA was still largest in the shell.

Because this neural pathway is also regulated by stress, and because stress has been shown to influence an animal's behavioral responses to drugs of abuse, it was of interest to determine whether repeated exposure to stress results in similar biochemical adaptations. By use of immunoblot analysis, we show here that a course of chronic "unpredictable" stress, like chronic drug exposure, increased levels of immunoreactivity of tyrosine hydroxylase and glial fibrillary acidic protein and decreased levels of immunoreactivity of neurofilament proteins in the VTA. Chronic unpredictable stress also increased levels of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity and decreased levels of immunoreactivity of the G protein subunit, Gi alpha, in the NAc. These effects required long-term exposure to stress and were in most cases not seen in the substantia nigra and caudate-putamen, components of the nigrostriatal dopamine system studied for comparison. The biochemical effects of chronic stress in the VTA and NAc differed among three strains of rat studied. Fischer 344 rats were the most responsive in that they exhibited all of the aforementioned adaptations, whereas Lewis rats were the least responsive in that they exhibited none of these adaptations; Sprague-Dawley rats exhibited an intermediate number of responses. Taken together, the results of the present study demonstrate that chronic exposure to stress results in biochemical adaptations in the mesolimbic dopamine system that resemble the chronic actions of several drugs of abuse. These adaptations could contribute to the convergent behavioral effects induced by treatments that are mediated via the VTA-NAc pathway.}",

abstract = "{Drugs of abuse share with conventional reinforcers the activation of specific neural pathways in the CNS that are the substrate of their motivational properties. Dopamine is recognized as the transmitter of one such neural pathway, being involved in at least three major aspects of motivation: modulation of motivational state, acquisition (incentive learning) and expression of incentive properties by motivational stimuli. Drugs of abuse of different pharmacological classes stimulate in the low dose range dopamine transmission particularly in the ventral striatum. Apart from psychostimulants, the evidence that stimulation of dopamine transmission by drugs of abuse provides the primary motivational stimulus for drug self-administration is either unconvincing or negative. However, stimulation of dopamine transmission is essential for the activational properties of drugs of abuse and might be instrumental for the acquisition of responding to drug-related incentive stimuli (incentive learning). Dopamine is involved in the induction and in the expression of behavioural sensitization by repeated exposure to various drugs of abuse. Sensitization to the dopamine-stimulant properties of specific drug classes leading to facilitation of incentive learning of drug-related stimuli might account for the strong control over behaviour exerted by these stimuli in the addiction state. Withdrawal from drugs of abuse results in a reduction in basal dopamine transmission in vivo and in reduced responding for conventional reinforcers. Although these changes are likely to be the expression of a state of dependence of the dopamine system their contribution to the motivational state of drug addiction is unclear.}",

No significant impairment of CTA was obtained after administration of the specific D(2)/D(3) antagonist raclopride (100 and 300 microg/kg, s.c.). The ability of SCH 23390 to impair CTA learning was confirmed by its ability to reduce the conditional aversive reactions to a gustatory CS (sweet chocolate) as estimated in a taste reactivity paradigm. SCH 39166 impaired CTA also when infused in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell 5 min after the CS. No impairment was obtained from the NAc core or from the bed nucleus stria terminalis. The results indicate that D(1) receptor blockade impairs CTA learning by disrupting the formation of a short-term memory trace of the gustatory CS and that endogenous dopamine acting on D(1) receptors in the NAc shell plays a role in short-term memory processes related to associative gustatory learning.}",

abstract = "{This study examined localization of positive versus negative motivational functions mediated by GABA circuits within the accumbens shell. Microinjections of a GABA(A) agonist (0, 25, 75, and 225 ng/0.5 microl muscimol) in rostral shell sites elicited appetitive increases in eating behavior. In contrast, microinjections in caudal shell sites elicited defensive burying or paw-treading behavior. Rats whose microinjections landed bilaterally outside of the accumbens shell did not display either behavior. Defensive treading elicited by caudal shell muscimol microinjection appeared to be a negative motivated response to threat (similar in parameters and orientation to normal defensive burying of a threatening electrified shock prod). The nucleus accumbens shell thus appears functionally heterogeneous in coding motivational valence. The demonstration that muscimol elicits positive eating behavior from rostral shell versus negative defensive behavior from caudal shell suggests in particular that GABAergic substrates of positive and negative types of motivated behavior in the nucleus accumbens shell are segregated along a rostrocaudal gradient.}",

Originally studied in human infants, affective reactions to taste have also been used by affective neuroscience to identify hedonic brain systems in studies of animals (via application of neural stimulation, pharmacological activation, and neural lesion manipulations). The chief limitation of measuring affective reactions is that it is difficult for experimenters to know how to interpret them, and therefore how to interpret changes produced by brain manipulations. This paper notes guidelines to interpretation. It examines the phylogenetic continuity between humans, other primates, and rats in terms of the microstructure of taste-elicited affective reactions. It reviews evidence that affective taste reactivity patterns truly reflect a 'core hedonic process' of palatability or affect, rather than being an ingestion measure, consummatory behavior measure, or a sensory reflex measure. It reviews affective neuroscience studies of taste reactivity that have identified true hedonic brain substrates, and discriminated them from false hedonic brain substrates. It considers the neural bases of incentive 'wanting' versus 'liking'. Finally, it notes the difference between human subjective affective ratings of pleasure and 'core hedonic processes' reflected by behavioral affective reactions.}",

Primates and humans have developed an extraordinary capacity to process information "on line," a capacity that is widely considered to underlay comprehension, thinking, and so-called executive functions. Understanding the interactions between the major cellular constituents of cortical circuits-pyramidal and nonpyramidal cells-is considered a necessary step in unraveling the cellular mechanisms subserving working memory mechanisms and, ultimately, cognitive processes. Evidence from a variety of sources is accumulating to indicate that dopamine has a major role in regulating the excitability of the cortical circuitry upon which the working memory function of prefrontal cortex depends. Here, I describe several direct and indirect intercellular mechanisms for modulating working memory function in prefrontal cortex based on the localization of dopamine receptors on the distal dendrites and spines of pyramidal cells and on interneurons in the prefrontal cortex. Interactions between monoamines and a compromised cortical circuitry may hold the key to understanding the variety of memory disorders associated with aging and disease.}",

Drugs of abuse activate CREB in the nucleus accumbens, an important part of the brain's reward pathways, and local manipulations of CREB activity have been shown to affect cocaine reward, suggesting an active role of CREB in adaptive processes that follow exposure to drugs of abuse. Using CRE-LacZ reporter mice, we show that not only rewarding stimuli such as morphine, but also aversive stimuli such as stress, activate CRE-mediated transcription in the nucleus accumbens shell. Using viral-mediated gene transfer to locally alter the activity of CREB, we show that this manipulation affects morphine reward, as well as the preference for sucrose, a more natural reward. We then show that local changes in CREB activity induce a more general syndrome, by altering reactions to anxiogenic, aversive, and nociceptive stimuli as well. Increased CREB activity in the nucleus accumbens shell decreases an animal's responses to each of these stimuli, whereas decreased CREB activity induces an opposite phenotype. These results show that environmental stimuli regulate CRE-mediated transcription within the nucleus accumbens shell, and that changes in CREB activity within this brain area subsequently alter gating between emotional stimuli and their behavioral responses. This control appears to be independent of the intrinsic appetitive or aversive value of the stimulus. The potential relevance of these data to addiction and mood disorders is discussed.}",

abstract = "{The ventral striatum, which prominently includes the nucleus accumbens (Acb), is a heterogeneous area. Within the Acb of rats, a peripherally located shell and a centrally situated core can be recognized that have different connectional, neurochemical, and functional identities. Although the Acb core resembles in many respects the dorsally adjacent caudate-putamen complex in its striatal character, the Acb shell has, in addition to striatal features, a more diverse array of neurochemical characteristics, and afferent and efferent connections. Inputs and outputs of the Acb, in particular of the shell, are inhomogeneously distributed, resulting in a mosaical arrangement of concentrations of afferent fibers and terminals and clusters of output neurons. To determine the precise relationships between the distributional patterns of various afferents (e.g., from the prefrontal cortex, the basal amygdaloid complex, the hippocampal formation, and the midline/intralaminar thalamic nuclei) and efferents to the ventral pallidum and mesencephalon, neuroanatomical anterograde and retrograde tracing experiments were carried out. The results of the double anterograde, double retrograde, and anterograde/retrograde tracing experiments indicate that various parts of the shell (dorsomedial, ventromedial, ventral, and lateral) and the core (medial and lateral) have different input-output characteristics. Furthermore, within these Acb regions, various populations of neurons can be identified, arranged in a cluster-like fashion, onto which specific sets of afferents converge and that project to particular output stations, distinct from the input-output relationships of neighboring, cluster-like neuronal populations. These results support the idea that the nucleus accumbens may consist of a collection of neuronal ensembles with different input-output relationships and, presumably, different functional characteristics.}",

Do they mediate hedonic reward learning and associative prediction? Our review of the literature, together with results of a new study of residual reward capacity after dopamine depletion, indicates the answer to both questions is 'no'. Rather, dopamine systems may mediate the incentive salience of rewards, modulating their motivational value in a manner separable from hedonia and reward learning. In a study of the consequences of dopamine loss, rats were depleted of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens and neostriatum by up to 99\% using 6-hydroxydopamine. In a series of experiments, we applied the 'taste reactivity' measure of affective reactions (gapes, etc.) to assess the capacity of dopamine-depleted rats for: 1) normal affect (hedonic and aversive reactions), 2) modulation of hedonic affect by associative learning (taste aversion conditioning), and 3) hedonic enhancement of affect by non-dopaminergic pharmacological manipulation of palatability (benzodiazepine administration). We found normal hedonic reaction patterns to sucrose vs. quinine, normal learning of new hedonic stimulus values (a change in palatability based on predictive relations), and normal pharmacological hedonic enhancement of palatability. We discuss these results in the context of hypotheses and data concerning the role of dopamine in reward. We review neurochemical, electrophysiological, and other behavioral evidence. We conclude that dopamine systems are not needed either to mediate the hedonic pleasure of reinforcers or to mediate predictive associations involved in hedonic reward learning. We conclude instead that dopamine may be more important to incentive salience attributions to the neural representations of reward-related stimuli. Incentive salience, we suggest, is a distinct component of motivation and reward. In other words, dopamine systems are necessary for 'wanting' incentives, but not for 'liking' them or for learning new 'likes' and 'dislikes'.}",

abstract = "{Considerable experimental and clinical evidence links forebrain dopamine (DA) systems to the performance of motor activities and to motivational processes. Much of the support for this conclusion was obtained from studies utilizing lesions or drugs to manipulate aspects of central dopaminergic function. Although such experiments yield important information concerning the behavioral consequences of interference with DA systems in brain, they do not demonstrate any relation between the dynamic activity of DA neurons and the level or type of motor function exhibited by the organism. This review discusses the emerging field of behavioral neurochemistry, and provides an overview of recent studies investigating the relation between nucleus accumbens DA release and behavior. Particular emphasis is placed upon current research involving microdialysis, voltammetry and electrophysiology. These different methods are viewed as complementary techniques for investigating the activity of DA systems in behaving animals. Evidence indicates that DA activity is most reliably activated by stimuli that trigger instrumental behavior and during the preparatory or instrumental phase of motivated behavior. The effects of consummatory reactions to positive reinforcers are somewhat equivocal; with food consumption, dialysis studies have yielded inconsistent results, while some voltammetric and electrophysiological studies have shown that DA activity in accumbens or ventral tegmental area actually decreases during consumption of food reinforcement. Moreover, the responsiveness of accumbens DA activity during behavioral stimulation is not unique to appetitive conditions, as several studies have shown that aversive or stressful conditions also stimulate accumbens DA release or metabolism. It is reasonable to suggest at this time that accumbens DA neurons are activated by a variety of different motivational conditions, but that the consequence of that activation is to modulate the behavioral reactivity of the organism. This type of function is seen as representing an area of overlap between motor and motivational processes.}",

Brainstem cholecystokinin afferents also reach more rostral parts of the ventral striatum including the rostrolateral olfactory tubercle. The ascending cholecystokinin axons enter the medial forebrain bundle at the meso-diencephalic border and maintain a rough medial to lateral topography at the caudal diencephalon. A second major cholecystokinin pathway, with possible origin in the piriform and medial prefrontal cortices and/or the amygdala, projects to the subcommissural caudate-putamen, the olfactory tubercle, the lateral part of the nucleus accumbens and the dorsal part of the bed nucleus of stria terminalis. Finally, the rostral part of the dorsal caudate-putamen receives a substantial cholecystokinin innervation from the basolateral amygdala and possibly from the neocortex. According to radioimmunological data, the descending telencephalic cholecystokinin system accounts for about 60\% of all cholecystokinin in the rostral forebrain. The combined use of morphological and biochemical methods provided evidence for a partially overlapping distribution and possible interaction between an ascending brainstem and descending telencephalic cholecystokinin fiber systems within the striatum and related rostral forebrain areas.}",

Addictive drugs share with conventional reinforcers the property of stimulating dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens shell. This response, however, undergoes one-trial habituation in the case of conventional reinforcers but not of drugs. Resistance to habituation allows drugs to repetitively activate dopamine transmission in the shell upon repeated self-administration. This process abnormally facilitates associative learning, leading to the attribution of excessive motivational value to discrete stimuli or contexts predictive of drug availability. Addiction is therefore the expression of the excessive control over behavior acquired by drug-related stimuli as a result of abnormal strenghtening of stimulus-drug contingencies by nondecremental drug-induced stimulation of dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens shell.}",

Presentation of the tone after 3-4 weeks of abstinence resulted in a cue-induced relapse of drug seeking under extinction conditions. Accumbens neurons did not exhibit tone-evoked activity before cocaine self-administration training but exhibited significant SD tone-evoked activity during extinction. Under extinction conditions, shell neurons exhibited significantly greater activity evoked by the SD tone than that evoked by a neutral tone (i.e., never paired with reinforcement). In contrast, core neurons responded indiscriminately to presentations of the SD tone or the neutral tone. Accumbens shell neurons exhibited significantly greater SD tone-evoked activity than did accumbens core neurons. Although the onset of SD tone-evoked activity occurred well before the earliest movements commenced (150 msec), this activity often persisted beyond the onset of tone-evoked movements.

The functions of the NAcc core and shell were investigated in mediating amphetamine-potentiated conditioned reinforcement and locomotion. Rats were initially trained to associate a neutral stimulus (Pavlovian CS) with food reinforcement (US). After excitotoxic lesions that selectively destroyed either the NAcc core or shell, animals underwent additional CS-US training sessions and then were tested for the acquisition of a new instrumental response that produced the CS acting as a conditioned reinforcer (CR). Animals were infused intra-NAcc with D-amphetamine (0, 1, 3, 10, or 20 microg) before each session. Shell lesions affected neither Pavlovian nor instrumental conditioning but completely abolished the potentiative effect of intra-NAcc amphetamine on responding with CR. Core-lesioned animals were impaired during the Pavlovian retraining sessions but showed no deficit in the acquisition of responding with CR. However, the selectivity in stimulant-induced potentiation of the CR lever was reduced, as intra-NAcc amphetamine infusions dose-dependently increased responding on both the CR lever and a nonreinforced (control) lever. Shell lesions produced hypoactivity and attenuated amphetamine-induced activity. In contrast, core lesions resulted in hyperactivity and enhanced the locomotor-stimulating effect of amphetamine. These results indicate a functional dissociation of subregions of the NAcc; the shell is a critical site for stimulant effects underlying the enhancement of responding with CR and locomotion after intra-NAcc injections of amphetamine, whereas the core is implicated in mechanisms underlying the expression of CS-US associations.}",

All animals acquired the lever-press response although the rate of acquisition and overall response rates in core-lesioned animals were depressed relative to that in the shell- or sham-lesioned animals. Furthermore, in shell- and sham-lesioned rats, post-training devaluation of one of the two outcomes using a specific satiety procedure produced a selective reduction in performance on the lever that, in training, delivered the prefed outcome. In contrast, the core-lesioned rats failed to show a selective devaluation effect and reduced responding on both levers. Subsequent tests revealed that these effects of core lesions were not caused by an impairment in their ability to recall the devalued outcome, to discriminate the two outcomes, or to encode the instrumental action-outcome contingencies to which they were exposed. Additionally, the core lesions did not have any marked effect on Pavlovian conditioning or on Pavlovian-instrumental transfer. Importantly, although shell-lesioned rats showed no deficit in any test of instrumental conditioning or in Pavlovian conditioning, they failed to show any positive transfer in the Pavlovian-instrumental transfer test.

Each drug was ineffective or markedly less effective when injected at a slightly more dorsal and lateral site in the core of nucleus accumbens. Self-administration of PCP, MK-801, or CPP directly into nucleus accumbens was not altered by co-infusion of a dose of the dopamine antagonist sulpiride that effectively blocked intracranial self-administration of the dopamine uptake inhibitor nomifensine, suggesting that the rewarding actions of the NMDA receptor antagonists are not dopamine-dependent. Rats also developed lever-pressing habits when PCP, MK-801, and CPP were each microinjected directly into frontal cortex, a region previously associated with the rewarding actions of cocaine but not nomifensine. Thus nucleus accumbens and frontal cortex are each potential substrates for the rewarding properties of PCP and related drugs, and the ability of these drugs to disrupt NMDA receptor function seems sufficient to account for their rewarding actions.

Rats were first trained to press one of two levers to obtain sucrose pellets. They were separately conditioned to associate a Pavlovian cue (30 sec light) with free sucrose pellets. On test days, the rats received bilateral microinjection of intra-accumbens vehicle or amphetamine (0.0, 2.0, 10.0, or 20.0 microgram/0.5 microliter), and lever pressing was tested in the absence of any reinforcement contingency, while the Pavlovian cue alone was freely presented at intervals throughout the session. Amphetamine microinjection selectively potentiated the cue-elicited increase in sucrose-associated lever pressing, although instrumental responding was not reinforced by either sucrose or the cue during the test. Intra-accumbens amphetamine can therefore potentiate cue-triggered incentive motivation for reward in the absence of primary or secondary reinforcement. Using the taste reactivity measure of hedonic impact, it was shown that intra-accumbens amphetamine failed to increase positive hedonic reaction patterns elicited by sucrose (i.e., sucrose "liking") at doses that effectively increase sucrose "wanting." We conclude that nucleus accumbens dopamine specifically mediates the ability of reward cues to trigger "wanting" (incentive salience) for their associated rewards, independent of both hedonic impact and response reinforcement.}",

It is intended that from the considerations recorded here a conceptual framework will begin to emerge that is amenable to further experimental substantiation as regards how multiple basal forebrain systems and the cortices to which they are related by connections work together to fashion a unitary object--the adaptive response.}",

title = "{Activation of feeding-related neural circuitry after unilateral injections of muscimol into the nucleus accumbens shell}",
abstract = "{Chemical inhibition of neurons in the nucleus accumbens shell (AcbSh) elicits intense, behaviorally specific, feeding in satiated rats. We have demonstrated previously that this treatment activates a number of brain regions, most significantly the lateral hypothalamus (LH). This activation could be elicited through a direct neural connection with the AcbSh or secondarily through changes in autonomic activity, stress, or circulating levels of orexigenic or satiety factors. In the present study, we used the immunohistochemical localization of Fos protein to map neuronal activation after unilateral muscimol injections into the AcbSh to determine whether AcbSh-mediated Fos expression remains lateralized in the circuit and whether secondary systemic changes in the rat can be excluded as primary factors in the activation of downstream component nuclei. Rats receiving only saline injections exhibited very little Fos immunoreactivity. In contrast, unilateral injections of muscimol into the AcbSh consistently increased Fos expression in several brain regions. Three distinct patterns of expression were observed. Fos synthesis in the LH was increased only on the side of the brain ipsilateral to the muscimol injection. Fos expression remained primarily ipsilateral to the injection site in the septohypothalamic, paraventricular hypothalamic (PVN), paratenial thalamic, and lateral habenular nuclei, and medial substantia nigra, but was increased bilaterally in the piriform cortex, supraoptic nucleus, central nucleus of the amygdala, and nucleus of the solitary tract. Smaller numbers of Fos-immunoreactive cells were seen unilaterally in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial ventral pallidum, arcuate nucleus, and ventral tegmental area and bilaterally in the supraoptic and tuberomammillary nuclei. The labeling in the LH, PVN, and other unilaterally labeled structures provides evidence that these brain regions are components of an AcbSh-mediated neural circuit and suggests that they may be involved in the expression of AcbSh-mediated feeding behavior.}",

title = "{Dynamics of neural coding in the accumbens during extinction and reinstatement of rewarded behavior}",
abstract = "{Neural correlates of reward-seeking behavior are observed in the nucleus accumbens (NAC). The dependence of these correlates upon the presence of a reward was studied by comparing the behavioral correlates observed when the presence of the reward was manipulated within a single behavioral session. Rats were well-trained on a continuous reinforcement instrumental task reinforced by 0.1 ml drops of 5\% sucrose. Extracellular single-unit neural activity was recorded from electrode arrays implanted into the NAC when instrumental behavior was and then was not reinforced with sucrose (within-session extinction). A variable delay between the instrumental response and the sucrose delivery allowed for separation of neural activity related to these task events. A spike activity increase around the time of the instrumental response was the most common behavioral correlate, while a decrease in spike activity upon sucrose delivery was the second most common behavioral correlate. Following removal of the reinforcer, subjects continued to perform the instrumental response, allowing for the examination of response-related spike activity under extinction conditions in which the response was no longer reinforced by sucrose. A majority of the response-related neural activity patterns were lost when sucrose was no longer available. New neural responses also were detected during this period. For some subjects, the reinforcer was again made available during the same session. Encoding of the primary behavioral events during this period of reinstated reinforcer was similar, but not identical, to that observed during the first period of reinforced responding. These findings reveal that instrumental task-associated spike activity within the NAC is partially dependent upon the presence of the reinforcer, and that encoding across the population is distinct under reinforced and extinction conditions.}",

abstract = "{The pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg) contains a population of cholinergic neurons (the Ch5 group) and non-cholinergic neurons. There appears to be functional interdigitation between these two groups, which both have extensive projections. The principal ascending connections are with thalamic nuclei and structures associated with the striatum, including the substantial nigra pars compacta. The descending connections are with a variety of nuclei in the pons, medulla and spinal cord, concerned with autonomic and motor functions. In the past, emphasis has been laid on the role of the PPTg in locomotion and behavioural state control. In this review, we emphasise the role of the PPTg in processing outputs from the striatum. The non-cholinergic neurons receive outflow from both dorsal and vental striatum, and lesions of the PPTg disrupt behaviour associated with each of these. Our review indicates that the PPTg is less concerned with the induction of locomotion and more concerned with relating reinforcement (information about which comes from the ventral striatum) with motor output from the dorsal striatum. The conclusions we draw are: (1) the PPTg is an outflow system for the striatum, but also forms a 'subsidiary circuit', returning information to striatal circuitry; in this, the PPTg has an anatomical organisation that resembles that of the substantia nigra. (2) As well as a role in the mediation of REM sleep, cholinergic PPTg neurons have an important role in the waking state, providing feedback into the thalamus and striatum. (3) The precise function of the computations performed on striatal outflow by the PPTg is uncertain. We discuss whether this function is complementary (parallel to other routes of striatal outflow), integrative (modifying other forms of striatal outflow) or both.}",

The main aim of this study was to determine the degree of topographical organization in the outputs of the ventral pallidum. In the telencephalon, ventral pallidal fibers reach the prefrontal cortex, the ventral striatum, the lateral septum, the basolateral, lateral, and central amygdaloid nuclei, and the lateral entorhinal area. Diencephalic targets of ventral pallidal fibers are the lateral hypothalamus, the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, the dorsomedial part of the subthalamic nucleus, the medial part of the parafascicular nucleus and the lateral habenula. In the mesencephalon, ventral pallidal fibers terminate in the ventral tegmental area, the substantia nigra, the retrorubral area, the median raphe nucleus, the nucleus raphe magnus, the peribrachial area, the ventromedial part of the central gray substance and the locus coeruleus. The results of the experiments in which retrograde tracers were injected in different nuclei in the mesencephalon allow the distinction of two main areas in the ventral pallidum. Deposits of retrograde tracers in the substantia nigra, pars reticulata result in labeling of cells in the dorsolateral part of the ventral pallidum, located immediately ventral to the anterior limb of the anterior commissure. Retrograde tracer injections in other targets of the ventral mesencephalon, i.e. the dopaminergic cell groups A10, A9 or A8, or nuclei in the peribrachial area result in labeling of neurons in an extensive ventromedial and ventrolateral zone of the ventral pallidum. The medial part of this ventral pallidal zone projects to the ventral tegmental area, whereas ventral and lateral parts connect with more lateral and caudal mesencephalic targets. The projections from the ventral pallidum to the ventral striatum, the subthalamic nucleus and adjacent lateral hypothalamic area, and the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus are distinctly topographically organized. The ventral pallidostriatal projections preserve a medial-to-lateral, a dorsal-to-ventral and, to a lesser degree, a rostral-to-caudal topography. With respect to the subthalamic region, the dorsolateral part of the ventral pallidum projects to the dorsomedial part of the subthalamic nucleus, whereas the ventromedial and ventrolateral parts of the ventral pallidum are topographically connected with the area of the lateral hypothalamus medially adjacent to the subthalamic nucleus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)}",

If this is so, it follows that the outputs of the two structures should be substantially similar. To address this, projections from the caudomedial shell and central nucleus of the amygdala, a key extended amygdala structure, were demonstrated in Sprague-Dawley rats with different anterograde axonal tracers processed separately to exhibit distinguishable brown and blue-black precipitates. The caudomedial shell projection is strong in the ventral pallidum and along the medial forebrain bundle through the lateral preopticohypothalamic continuum into the ventral tegmental area, distal to which it thins abruptly. The central nucleus projects strongly to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the sublenticular extended amygdala, but substantially to the lateral hypothalamus only at levels behind the rostral part of the entopeduncular nucleus. Innervation of the ventral tegmental area by the central amygdala is minimal, but the lateral one-third of the substantia nigra, pars compacta and an adjacent lateral part of the retrorubral field receive substantial central amygdala input. Central amygdaloid projections are robust in caudal brainstem sites, such as the reticular formation, parabrachial nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract and dorsal vagal complex, all of which receive little input from the accumbens. The substantial differences in the output systems of the caudomedial shell of accumbens and central amygdala suggest that the two represent distinct functional-anatomical systems.}",

title = "{Organization of cerebral cortical afferent systems in the rat. II. Hypothalamocortical projections}",
abstract = "{The organization of hypothalamic projections to the cerebral cortex in the rat has been studied using retrograde and anterograde tracer methods. Four separate populations of hypothalamic neurons, which constitute a major source of diffuse cortical innervation, were identified: Tuberal lateral hypothalamic (LHAt) neurons which innervate the cerebral cortex tend to cluster in the perifornical region, in the zona incerta, and along the medial edge of the cerebral peduncle, at levels roughly coextensive with the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus. Most of these neurons project to the ipsilateral cortex; a small percentage innervate the contralateral cortex, but this varies among cortical terminal fields. The perifornical neurons are organized in a roughly topographic medial-to-lateral relationship with respect to their cortical terminal fields. Field of Forel (FF) neurons, which project primarily to the frontal cortex of the ipsilateral hemisphere, are located just ventral to the medial edge of the medial lemniscus, at the level of the ventromedial basal thalamic nucleus. The more laterally placed neurons innervate the lateral frontal, insular and perirhinal cortex; the more medial neurons, around the mammillothalamic tract, innervate the medial frontopolar, prelimbic, infralimbic, and anterior cingulate cortex. Posterior lateral hypothalamic (LHAp) neurons form a dense cluster spanning the lateral hypothalamus, from the cerebral peduncle to the posterior hypothalamic area at premammillary levels, and extending into the supramammillary nucleus and the adjacent ventral tegmental area. LHAp neurons innervate the entire cerebral cortex, predominantly on the ipsilateral side. Populations of LHAp neurons projecting to different cortical target areas show considerable spatial overlap, but computer plots of the centers of these populations demonstrate a strict topographic relationship with respect to the cerebral cortex. Tuberomammillary (TMN) neurons form a sheet along the ventrolateral surface of the premammillary hypothalamus. About twice as many TMN neurons innervate the ipsilateral, as compared to the contralateral hemisphere; it is not known whether single neurons project to both hemispheres. No topographic organization of the TMN cortical projection is apparent. Injections of different-colored fluorescent dyes into various cortical areas demonstrate that hypothalamic neurons in general have rather restricted cortical terminal fields. Only occasional neurons are found, primarily in LHAt, which are double labeled by injections into different cytoarchitectonic areas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)}",

title = "{The switching model of latent inhibition: an update of neural substrates}",
abstract = "{Organisms exposed to a stimulus which has no significant consequences, show subsequently latent inhibition (LI), namely, retarded conditioning to this stimulus. LI is considered to index the capacity to ignore irrelevant stimuli and its disruption has recently received increasing interest as an animal model of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Initial studies indicated that LI is disrupted by systemic or intra-accumbens injections of amphetamine and hippocampal lesions, and potentiated by systemic administration of neuroleptics. On the basis of these findings, the switching model of LI proposed that LI depends on the subicular input to the nucleus accumbens (NAC). Subsequent studies supported and refined this proposition. Lesion studies show that LI is indeed disrupted by severing the subicular input to the NAC, and further implicate the entorhinal/ventral subicular portion of this pathway projecting to the shell subterritory of the NAC. There is a functional dissociation between the shell and core subterritories of the NAC, with lesions of the former but not of the latter disrupting LI. This suggests that the shell is necessary for the expression and the core for the disruption of LI. The involvement of the NAC has been also demonstrated by findings that LI is disrupted by intra-accumbens injection of amphetamine and potentiated by DA depletion or blockade in this structure. Disruption and potentiation of LI by systemic administration of amphetamine and neuroleptics, respectively, have been firmly established, and in addition, have been shown to be sensitive to parametric manipulations of the LI procedure. LI is unaffected by lesions and DA manipulations of medial prefrontal cortex and lesions of basolateral amygdala. The implications of these findings for LI as an animal model of schizophrenia are discussed.}",

In the core of the nucleus accumbens as well as in the border region between the nucleus accumbens and the caudate-putamen, leu-enkephalin-rich areas are in register with opioid receptor-dense areas. In the shell region the precise relationship between the enkephalin and the naloxone patterns could not be established. A comparison of the connectivity patterns and neurochemical characteristics of the opioid receptor-dense compartments in the nucleus accumbens with those in the caudate-putamen reveals major discrepancies between these two striatal subdivisions. We therefore conclude that, rather than a bicompartmental patch/striosome-matrix organization, the nucleus accumbens has a multicompartmental organization.}",

Of these brain regions, the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc) play central roles in the processing of rewarding environmental stimuli and in drug addiction. The psychoactive properties of marijuana are mediated by the active constituent, Delta(9)-THC, interacting primarily with CB1 cannabinoid receptors in a large number of brain areas. However, it is the activation of these receptors located within the central brain reward circuits that is thought to play an important role in sustaining the self-administration of marijuana in humans, and in mediating the anxiolytic and pleasurable effects of the drug. Here we describe the cellular circuitry of the VTA and the NAc, define the sites within these areas at which cannabinoids alter synaptic processes, and discuss the relevance of these actions to the regulation of reinforcement and reward. In addition, we compare the effects of Delta(9)-THC with those of other commonly abused drugs on these reward circuits, and we discuss the roles that endogenous cannabinoids may play within these brain pathways, and their possible involvement in regulating ongoing brain function, independently of marijuana consumption. We conclude that, whereas Delta(9)-THC alters the activity of these central reward pathways in a manner that is consistent with other abused drugs, the cellular mechanism through which this occurs is likely different, relying upon the combined regulation of several afferent pathways to the VTA.}",

To ascertain whether CB(1) mRNA was a marker for striatal efferents, digoxigenin-labeled probes for mRNA markers of both striatonigral (prodynorphin or preprotachykinin A mRNAs), and striatopallidal (proenkephalin mRNAs) projection neurons were combined with the (35)S-labeled probe for CB(1). A mediolateral gradient in CB(1) mRNA expression was observed at rostral and mid-striatal levels; in the same coronal sections the number of silver grains per cell ranged from below the threshold of detectability at the medial and ventral poles to saturation at the dorsolateral boundary bordered by the corpus callosum. At the caudal level examined, CB(1) mRNA was denser in the ventral sector relative to the dorsal sector. Virtually all neurons expressing mRNA markers for striatal projection neurons colocalized CB(1) mRNA. Combining a (35)S-labeled riboprobe for CB(1) with digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes for both preproenkephalin and prodynorphin confirmed localization of CB(1) mRNA to striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons expressing prodynorphin and preproenkephalin mRNAs, respectively. However, CB(1) mRNA-positive cells that failed to coexpress the other markers were also apparent. CB(1) mRNA was localized to putative GABAergic interneurons that express high levels of GAD67 mRNA.

By contrast, aspiny interneurons that express preprosomatostatin mRNA and cholinergic interneurons that coexpress ChAT and VAChT mRNAs were CB(1) mRNA-negative.

To investigate the possible mechanisms through which CB receptors may modulate GABAergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus, whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were performed on CA1 pyramidal neurons in rat brain slices. Stimulus-evoked GABA(A) receptor-mediated IPSCs were reduced in a concentration-dependent manner by the CB receptor agonist WIN 55,212-2 (EC(50) of 138 nM). This effect was blocked by the CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A (1 microM) but not by the opioid antagonist naloxone. In contrast, evoked GABA(B)-mediated IPSCs were insensitive to the CB agonist. WIN 55,212-2 also reduced the frequency of spontaneous, action potential-dependent IPSCs (sIPSCs), without altering action potential-independent miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs), measured while sodium channels were blocked by tetrodotoxin (TTX). Blockade of voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs) by cadmium also eliminated the effect of WIN 55,212-2 on sIPSCs. Depolarization of inhibitory terminals with elevated extracellular potassium caused a large increase in the frequency of mIPSCs that was inhibited by both cadmium and WIN 55,212-2. The presynaptic effect of WIN 55,212-2 was also investigated using the potassium channel blockers barium and 4-aminopyridine. Neither of these agents significantly altered the effect of WIN 55,212-2 on evoked IPSCs. Together, these data suggest that presynaptic CB1 receptors reduce GABA(A)- but not GABA(B)-mediated synaptic inhibition of CA1 pyramidal neurons by inhibiting VDCCs located on inhibitory nerve terminals.}",

In this study we identified different populations of ventral tegmental area neurons by the pharmacology of their evoked synaptic potentials and their response to dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine and opioids. Intracellular recordings were made from ventral tegmental area neurons in horizontal slices of guinea-pig brain and electrical stimulation was used to evoke synaptic potentials. The majority of cells (61.3\%) hyperpolarized in response to dopamine, depolarized to 5-hydroxytryptamine, failed to respond to [Met]5enkephalin and exhibited a slow GABAB-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potential. A smaller proportion of cells (11.3\%) hyperpolarized in response to [Met]5enkephalin, depolarized to 5-hydroxytryptamine, failed to respond to dopamine and did not exhibit a slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential. These two groups of cells corresponded to previously described "principal" and "secondary" cells, respectively. A further group of cells (27.4\%) was identified that like the principal cells, hyperpolarized to dopamine. However, these "tertiary cells" also hyperpolarized to both 5-hydroxytryptamine and [Met]5enkephalin and exhibited a slow, cocaine-sensitive 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A)-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potential. When principal and tertiary cells were investigated immunohistochemically, 82\% of the principal cells were positive for tyrosine hydroxylase compared with only 29\% of the tertiary cells. The 5-hydroxytryptamine innervation of both these cell types was investigated and a similar density of putative contacts was observed near the somata and dendrites in both groups. This latter finding suggests that the existence of a 5-hydroxytryptamine-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potential in the tertiary cells may be determined by the selective expression of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors, rather than the distribution or density of the 5-hydroxytryptamine innervation. We conclude that tertiary cells are a distinct subset of ventral tegmental area neurons where cocaine and mu-opioids both mediate inhibition.}",

title = "{GABA-containing neurons in the rat ventral tegmental area project to the prefrontal cortex}",
abstract = "{Dopamine-containing projections from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) have been extensively characterized since their discovery over 25 years ago. However, the VTA projection to the PFC also contains a substantial nondopamine component, whose neurochemical phenotype is unknown. To examine if a portion of this nondopamine VTA projection contains GABA, anterograde and retrograde tract-tracing in the rat was combined with GABA immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy. Following injections of Fluoro-Gold (FG) into the PFC, many VTA neurons were retrogradely labeled, as visualized by immunoperoxidase staining for FG. A large portion of FG-labeled somata (58\%) and dendrites (33\%) within the VTA also contained immunogold-silver labeling for GABA. These dually labeled profiles exhibited a morphology similar to dopamine-containing cells within the VTA. To confirm and extend these findings, anterograde transport of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) from the VTA was combined with immunogold-silver labeling for GABA within the PFC. Consistent with the results obtained from retrograde tracing, a portion of BDA-labeled terminals in the PFC also contained immunoreactivity for GABA. These dually labeled terminals formed symmetric synapses onto small caliber dendrites and dendritic spines. Some PFC dendrites contacted by GABA-containing VTA terminals were themselves GABA-labeled. The results of this investigation have identified a substantial population of GABA-containing neurons in the VTA that send axons to the PFC where they synapse on the distal processes of both pyramidal and local circuit neurons. This GABA-containing mesocortical pathway may provide substrates for both inhibitory and disinhibitory influences on PFC neuronal activity.}",

abstract = "{The ventral tegmental area receives a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) innervation from the nucleus accumbens and contains GABA immunoreactive neurons believed to be interneurons. We combined the immunocytochemical detection of retrogradely transported Fluoro-Gold (FG) from the nucleus accumbens (Acb) with the detection of GABA within the same section of tissue in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the rat brain to determine whether there might also be reciprocal GABAergic projections in the mesolimbic pathway. Immunoperoxidase labeling for FG and immunogold-silver labeling for GABA were most readily distinguished within perikarya and dendrites in sections examined by electron microscopy. Ultrastructural observations indicated that 36\% (n = 110) of the FG-labeled perikarya and dendrites also contained GABA immunoreactivity. The present results provide the first evidence that GABA is contained in a subpopulation of neurons in the mesolimbic pathway from the VTA to the Acb. The reciprocity of this circuitry may provide an important feedback loop thus facilitating inhibition of motor activity.}",

abstract = "{GABAergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play a primary role in local inhibition of mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) neurons but are not physiologically or anatomically well characterized. We used in vivo extracellular and intracellular recordings in the rat VTA to identify a homogeneous population of neurons that were distinguished from DA neurons by their rapid-firing, nonbursting activity (19.1 +/- 1.4 Hz), short-duration action potentials (310 +/- 10 microseconds), EPSP-dependent spontaneous spikes, and lack of spike accommodation to depolarizing current pulses. These non-DA neurons were activated both antidromically and orthodromically by stimulation of the internal capsule (IC; conduction velocity, 2.4 +/- 0.2 m/sec; refractory period, 0.6 +/- 0.1 msec) and were inhibited by stimulation of the nucleus accumbens septi (NAcc). Their firing rate was moderately reduced, and their IC-driven activity was suppressed by microelectrophoretic application or systemic administration of NMDA receptor antagonists. VTA non-DA neurons were recorded intracellularly and showed relatively depolarized resting membrane potentials (-61.9 +/- 1.8 mV) and small action potentials (68.3 +/- 2.1 mV). They were injected with neurobiotin and shown by light microscopic immunocytochemistry to be multipolar cells and by electron microscopy to contain GABA but not the catecholamine-synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Neurobiotin-filled dendrites containing GABA received asymmetric excitatory-type synapses from unlabeled terminals and symmetric synapses from terminals that also contained GABA. These findings indicate that VTA non-DA neurons are GABAergic, project to the cortex, and are controlled, in part, by a physiologically relevant NMDA receptor-mediated input from cortical structures and by GABAergic inhibition.}",

abstract = "{Restricted feeding schedules (RFS) entrain behavioral and physiological rhythms even in suprachiasmatic nucleus ablated animals, suggesting the existence of a food-entrained oscillator. The nucleus accumbens is an important structure for the expression of motivational behaviors and because its anatomical subterritories, Shell (Acc-Sh) and Core (Acc-Co) establish connections with different functional systems, they may participate in a differential way in food-entrainment. A first experiment, explored the role of Acc-Sh and Acc-Co in food-entrainment using the immunohistochemical detection of the protein c-Fos as a transcriptional activation marker. Experiment 2 tested the differential effect of Acc-Sh and Acc-Co, NMDA excitotoxic lesions. Lesioned rats were entrained to RFS and locomotor activity and free fatty acids (FFA) concentrations were evaluated. Results data show that in the Acc-Sh there is an increase of c-Fos immunoreactivity in food-entrained rats principally during feeding, whereas c-Fos expression in the Acc-Co region was increased during feeding and also anticipating mealtime. FFA were entrained in both lesioned groups, but the basal level was lower in Core-lesion rats. All rats exhibited food anticipatory activity (FAA). However, FAA was increased in Shell-lesioned animals and was almost abolished in the Core-lesion rats. These data indicate that the accumbens nucleus is involved with behavioral and metabolic food-entrainment, and that there is a differential role between both subregions.}",

title = "{Feeding-entrained circadian rhythms are attenuated by lesions of the parabrachial region in rats}",
abstract = "{Rats anticipate daily restricted meals with increased approaches to a feeder and an increase in core body temperature. Food anticipatory activity (FAA) is thought to be under the control of a feeding-entrained circadian oscillator. Although numerous forebrain lesions have failed to permanently abolish FAA, the hindbrain has not been investigated. The parabrachial nuclei (PBN) integrate information from visceral and gustatory afferents. This region is also innervated by neurons in the area postrema that have access to the peripheral circulation. Therefore, it is possible that this region plays a role in triggering FAA. In two experiments, a total of 19 rats were given ibotenic acid or electrolytic lesions targeted at the PBN. The PBN-lesioned animals showed a marked attenuation in anticipatory approaches to the food bin relative to sham-operated controls. Some animals did not anticipate the meal at all. In addition, the expected increase in core body temperature was severely attenuated in the PBN-lesioned animals compared with controls. The most likely interpretation of these data is that the PBN serve as a relay for information about the zeitgeber (food in the gut) or as a clock output pathway, but not as the site of the feeding-entrained circadian oscillator.}",

abstract = "{In a restrictive food environment, the homeostatic control system regulates body weight and adiposity with remarkable precision. However, this regulation appears to break down in many genetically predisposed individuals under conditions prevailing in the modern era characterized by a sedentary lifestyle and easy availability of large portions of palatable and calorically dense food. The nervous system is the main interface by which food-related environmental factors influence the regulatory process. Thus, focusing on the neural systems located in the telencephalon dealing with environmental factors, and on their connections with the homeostatic regulatory system distributed mainly in the hypothalamus and brainstem, should result in new drug targets and behavioral strategies for prevention and therapy. The structures providing this interface with the environment are involved in the initiation, procurement, and appetitive phases of ingestive behavior and associative learning before, during, and after the consummatory phase. It is thought that learned and unlearned representations of foods and food cues in the orbitofrontal and other cortical areas are filtered for affective/emotional value in the amygdala and for motivational salience in the nucleus accumbens/ventral striatum to initiate goal-directed motor programs. Internal state signals generated by the metabolic sensing mechanisms in the hypothalamus interact with each of these corticolimbic structures through reciprocal connections. While many projections from the hypothalamus contain the various "feeding peptides," the neurochemistry of projections to the hypothalamus has not been well characterized.}",

The main action of phencyclidine is as a non-competitive antagonist of the NMDA class of glutamate receptor. In the past few years, dramatic advances have been made in our understanding of the neuroanatomical and pathological basis of schizophrenia. In turn, these have allowed assessment of the ability of phencyclidine to produce equivalent changes in the rodent CNS. It has now become clear that chronic intermittent low doses of phencyclidine produce a pattern of metabolic and neurochemical changes in the rodent brain that mirror those observed in the brains of schizophrenic patients with impressive precision. This should be of enormous benefit in the search for new anti-psychotic drugs with improved efficacy against the full range of schizophrenic symptoms.}",

abstract = "{The ventral striatum is considered an interface between limbic and motor systems. We followed the orbital and medial prefrontal circuit through the monkey basal ganglia by analyzing the projection from this cortical area to the ventral striatum and the representation of orbitofrontal cortex via the striatum, in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra. Following injections of Lucifer yellow and horse radish peroxidase into the medial ventral striatum, there is a very densely labeled distribution of cells in areas 13a and 13b, primarily in layers V and VI, and in medial prefrontal areas 32 and 25. Injections into the shell of the nucleus accumbens labeled primarily areas 25 and 32. The reaction product in the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra supports previous studies demonstrating that efferent projections from the ventral striatum are represented topographically in the ventral pallidum and nontopographically in the substantia nigra, pars compacta. Tritiated amino acid or PHA-L tracer injections into orbitofrontal cortex produce dense patches of terminal labeling along the medial edge of the caudate nucleus and the dorsal part of the nucleus accumbens. These results demonstrate that the orbital prefrontal cortex projects primarily to the medial edge of the ventral striatum and to the core of the nucleus accumbens. The arrangement of terminals in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra show two different patterns. Thus, the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex is represented in a confined region of the globus pallidus but throughout an extensive area of the dorsal substantia nigra. Terminals are extensive throughout the region of the dopaminergic neurons, suggesting that this input may influence a wide area of both the striatum and frontal cortex.}",

abstract = "{A combination of anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques was used to study the projections to the nucleus accumbens from the amygdala, the hippocampal formation (including the entorhinal cortex), and the perirhinal cortex in two species of macaque monkey. To help identify possible subregions within the nucleus accumbens, the distribution of calbindin was examined in two additional monkeys. Although this revealed evidence of "core"- and "shell"-like regions within the accumbens, these different regions could not consistently be related to cytoarchitectonic features. The rostral amygdala sent nearly equivalent projections to both the medial and the lateral portions of nucleus accumbens, whereas projections arising from the middle and caudal amygdala terminated preferentially in the medial division of nucleus accumbens. The basal nucleus was the major source of these amygdala efferents, and there was a crude topography as parts of the basal and accessory basal nuclei terminated in different parts of nucleus accumbens. The subiculum was the major source of hippocampal projections to the nucleus accumbens, but some hippocampal efferents also originated in the parasubiculum, the prosubiculum, the adjacent portion of CA1, and the uncal portion of CA3. These hippocampal projections, which coursed through the fornix, showed a rostrocaudal gradient as more arose in the rostral hippocampus. Hippocampal efferents terminated most densely in the medial and ventral portions of nucleus accumbens, along with light label in the adjacent olfactory tubercle. The entorhinal projections were more evenly distributed between the medial nucleus accumbens and the olfactory tubercle, whereas the perirhinal projections were primarily to the olfactory tubercle. These cortical inputs were less reliant on the fornix. Amygdala and subicular (hippocampal) projections overlapped most completely in the medial division of nucleus accumbens.}",

title = "{New perspectives in basal forebrain organization of special relevance for neuropsychiatric disorders: the striatopallidal, amygdaloid, and corticopetal components of substantia innominata}",
abstract = "{The basal forebrain is critically involved in functions representing the highest levels of integration. Only recently has a relatively clear anatomical picture of this important area begun to emerge. The territory that has generally been referred to as the "substantia innominata" appears to be composed of portions of three recognizable forebrain structures: the ventral striatopallidal system, the extended amygdala and the magnocellular corticopetal system. (1) Rostrally, the striatopallidal system reaches ventrally to the base of the brain. (2) Caudal to the ventral extension of the striatopallidal system elements of the centromedial amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis are merged so that these two areas together with this subpallidal corridor form a large forebrain unit that might be described as an "extended amygdala". (3) Large cholinergic and non-cholinergic corticopetal neurons form a more or less continuous aggregate that is interwoven with the striatopallidal and extended amygdala systems in basal forebrain. Consideration of morphological and connectional characteristics of basal forebrain suggests that the corticopetal cell groups, together with magnocellular elements of the striatum, serve similar functional roles for the striatopallidal system, the extended amygdala, and the septal-diagonal band complex. Specifically, the output of medium spiny neurons in striatum, extended amygdala, and lateral septum are directed toward somewhat larger sparsely or moderately spiny neurons with radiating dendrites which in turn project to diencephalon and brainstem or provide either local feedback (e.g. in striatum) or distal feedback to cortex. The functional implications of this parallel processing of descending forebrain afferents are discussed.}",

title = "{D1 or D2 antagonism in nucleus accumbens core or dorsomedial shell suppresses lever pressing for food but leads to compensatory increases in chow consumption}",
abstract = "{Although interference with dopamine (DA) systems can suppress lever pressing for food reinforcement, it is not clear whether this effect occurs because of a general disruption of food motivation. One way of assessing this has been a choice procedure in which a rat responds on an fixed ratio 5 (FR5) schedule for preferred Bioserve pellets while a less preferred lab chow is concurrently available in the operant chamber. Untreated rats consume little of the chow, preferring to respond for the Bioserve pellets. Previous studies have shown that depleting DA in the accumbens substantially decreased lever pressing while increasing chow consumption. In the present study, low doses (0.0625-1.0 microg) of the D1 antagonist SCH 23390 or the D2 antagonist raclopride were injected into the either the core or shell subregions of nucleus accumbens, and rats were tested on the concurrent lever pressing/feeding task. Analysis of the dose response curves showed that injections of SCH 23390 into the core were more potent than injections into the shell for suppressing lever pressing (i.e., the ED(50) was lower in the core). Nevertheless, injections of either drug into either site suppressed lever pressing and increased intake of the concurrently available chow. Across both drugs and at both sites, the amount of chow consumed was negatively correlated with the total number of responses. Neither drug significantly increased response duration, suggesting that accumbens DA antagonism did not produce the type of motor impairment that leads to severe alterations in the form of lever pressing. In summary, the blockade of D1 or D2 receptors in nucleus accumbens core or shell decreased lever pressing for food reinforcers, but rats remained directed toward the acquisition and consumption of food. These results indicate that accumbens D1 antagonism does not decrease lever pressing because of a general reduction in food motivation. Nevertheless, interference with accumbens DA does appear to set constraints upon which responses are selected for obtaining food, and may impair the ability of animals to overcome work-related response costs in order to obtain food.}",

	Abstract = {After classically conditioned learning, dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) respond immediately to unexpected conditioned stimuli (CS) but omit formerly seen responses to expected unconditioned stimuli, notably rewards. These cells play an important role in reinforcement learning. A neural model explains the key neurophysiological properties of these cells before, during, and after conditioning, as well as related anatomical and neurophysiological data about the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTN), lateral hypothalamus, ventral striatum, and striosomes. The model proposes how two parallel learning pathways from limbic cortex to the SNc, one devoted to excitatory conditioning (through the ventral striatum, ventral pallidum, and PPTN) and the other to adaptively timed inhibitory conditioning (through the striosomes), control SNc responses. The excitatory pathway generates CS-induced excitatory SNc dopamine bursts. The inhibitory pathway prevents dopamine bursts in response to predictable reward-related signals. When expected rewards are not received, striosomal inhibition of SNc that is unopposed by excitation results in a phasic drop in dopamine cell activity. The adaptively timed inhibitory learning uses an intracellular spectrum of timed responses that is proposed to be similar to adaptively timed cellular mechanisms in the hippocampus and cerebellum. These mechanisms are proposed to include metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated Ca(2+) spikes that occur with different delays in striosomal cells. A dopaminergic burst in concert with a Ca(2+) spike is proposed to potentiate inhibitory learning. The model provides a biologically predictive alternative to temporal difference conditioning models and explains substantially more data than alternative models.},

	Abstract = {Long-lasting alterations in the efficacy of glutamatergic synapses, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), are prominent models for mechanisms of information storage in the brain. It has been suggested that exposure to drugs of abuse produces synaptic plasticity at glutamatergic synapses that shares many features with LTP and LTD, and that these synaptic changes may play roles in addiction. We have examined the involvement of particular neurotransmitters in synaptic plasticity at glutamatergic synapses within the striatum, a brain region with prominent roles in initiation and sequencing of actions, as well as habit formation. Our studies indicate that multiple neurotransmitters interact to produce striatal synaptic plasticity, and that the relative strength and patterning of the afferent inputs that release the various neurotransmitters determines whether LTP or LTD is activated. Drugs of abuse interact with glutamatergic synaptic plasticity in multiple ways, including alterations in dopamine release and more direct effects on glutamate release and glutamate receptors. We hypothesize that these effects contribute to addiction by facilitating the formation of new, drug-centered habits, and by disruption of more adaptive behaviors.},

This article discusses the LHA regarding dietary self-selection, responses to high-protein diets, amino acid imbalances, liquid and cafeteria diets, placentophagia, "stress eating," finickiness, diet texture, consistency and taste, aversion learning, olfaction and the effects of post-operative period manipulations by hormonal and other means. Glucose-sensitive neurons have been identified in the LHA and their manipulation by insulin and 2-deoxy-D-glucose is discussed. The effects on feeding of numerous transmitters, hormones and appetite depressants are described, as is the role of the LHA in salivation, lacrimation, gastric motility and secretion, and sensorimotor deficits. The LHA is also illuminated as regards temperature and feeding, circumventricular organs and thirst and electrolyte dynamics.

Dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens can be evoked by chemical stimulation of the afferent cell bodies using N-methyl-D-aspartate microinjection in the ventral tegmental area. We report here that following such injections most neurons of the nucleus accumbens were excited. This excitation was abolished if dopaminergic neurons were lesioned and was blocked by antagonists of the D1 dopamine receptors. Finally, excitatory responses to electrical stimulation of the hippocampus were strongly facilitated by endogenously released dopamine. We suggest, therefore, that under physiological conditions, dopamine acting on D1 receptors is actually an excitatory neurotransmitter.},

	Abstract = {Neurons in the lateral habenula (LHb) of rats have efferent projections that terminate in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC) and ventral tegmental area (VTA), where cell bodies of dopamine-containing neurons are located. In order to study the influence of the habenula on dopaminergic activity, single-cell electrophysiological techniques were used to record unit discharge of dopamine-containing neurons in the SNC and VTA during electrical stimulation of the LHb or adjacent structures. Dopamine-containing neurons in the SNC and VTA were identified by their characteristic spike duration (greater than 2 msec), discharge rate (2-8 spikes/sec), and irregular firing pattern. Analysis of peristimulus time histograms showed that 85% of SNC cells and 91% of VTA neurons were inhibited after single pulse stimulation (0.25 mA, 0.1 msec) of the LHb. The mean time between stimulation and onset of inhibition was 11 msec (range, 2-22 msec) and mean duration of maximal suppression was 76 msec (range, 20-250 msec). Stimulation of structures adjacent to the LHb (hippocampus, lateral thalamus, medial dorsal thalamus, medial habenula) had little or no effect. Destruction of the fasciculus retroflexus, the fiber pathway that contains most habenular efferents, blocked the stimulation effects on dopamine-containing neurons. Destruction of the stria medullaris, which contains most habenular afferents, did not alter the inhibitory effect of habenular stimulation. Injection of a cytotoxin, kainic acid, in the LHb 1 week before recording sessions blocked the inhibitory consequences of habenular stimulation. These experiments show that activation of neuronal perikarya in the LHb causes orthodromic inhibition of dopamine-containing neurons in SNC and VTA via the fasciculus retroflexus.},

@article{Morris.1999,
	Abstract = {Abnormal serotonergic function is implicated in the pathogenesis of affective disorders. We induced transient depressive relapses in volunteer patients by rapidly depleting plasma tryptophan, the precursor of serotonin (5-HT), and measured neural activity during different cognitive tasks using positron emission tomography (PET). Neural activity in several 5-HT-related brain areas, e.g., dorsal raph{\'{e}}, habenula, septal region, amygdala, and orbitofrontal cortex, covaried significantly with plasma levels of tryptophan and ratings of depressed mood. Task-specific responses in left amygdala and left anterior cingulate were attenuated by tryptophan depletion. We used these PET data to test the hypothesis that projections from the habenula modulate dorsal raph{\'{e}} activity and that this modulation is enhanced in patients experiencing a profound mood change following serotonergic challenge. A strong linear correlation (r(2) > 0.5) between habenula and raph{\'{e}} activity was observed in subjects with postdepletion ratings >/=10 on a modified Hamilton depression scale, whereas subjects experiencing milder changes in mood had weaker habenula-raph{\'{e}} coupling (r(2) < 0.5). These data support a model of the serotonergic system in which the habenula projection to the raph{\'{e}} represents a convergent feedback pathway that controls the release of 5-HT throughout the brain. In our experiment we were able to engage this system in patients who were sensitive to tryptophan depletion.},

@article{Van.1994,
	Abstract = {Microinfusion of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) into the ventral tegmental area enhances the release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens, a major target of midbrain dopamine neurons. We examined the synaptic basis for 5-HT modulation of neurons in the ventral tegmental area which either (i) project to the nucleus accumbens or (ii) contain the catecholamine synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, a marker of dopamine neurons in this brain region. In the first study, immunoperoxidase labeling of 5-HT in the ventral tegmental area was combined with retrograde transport of gold particles following unilateral injections of the tracer into the nucleus accumbens of adult rats. The gold particles had been previously coupled to wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to inactive horseradish peroxidase. Gold particles were enlarged for visualization using a silver enhancement procedure. By brightfield microscopy, retrogradely labeled neurons contained black punctate granules within their perikarya and proximal processes. The labeled cells were scattered ipsilateral to the injection within the paranigral and parabrachial subdivisions of the ventral tegmental area. Both regions also contained 5-HT immunoreactive varicosities. By electron microscopy, irrespective of the ventral tegmental subdivision, 5-HT labeling was seen primarily in unmyelinated axons and axon terminals. The terminals contained small, clear and large dense core vesicles and ranged from 0.3 micron to 1.4 microns in cross-sectional diameter. 22% (n = 250) of the axon terminals containing 5-HT immunoreactivity formed synaptic contacts with neurons containing the retrograde label. Of these 5-HT terminals, 16% formed asymmetric type contacts and 6% formed symmetric junctions on the retrogradely labeled neurons. The remaining 5-HT terminals were either apposed to (but lacked recognized synapses on) perikarya and large dendrites containing the retrogradely transported protein-gold tracer or contacted unlabeled neurons. In the second set of experiments combining immunoperoxidase of 5-HT and immunogold silver for tyrosine hydroxylase, 32% (n = 250) of the 5-HT-labeled terminals formed synaptic junctions with perikarya or dendrites containing tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity. Of these 5-HT terminals, 23% formed asymmetric type junctions. The remainder were either symmetric or lacked recognized membrane densities. The prominence of asymmetric junctions formed by 5-HT-labeled terminals on neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens and those containing tyrosine hydroxylase in the ventral tegmental area suggests a cellular basis for serotonergic excitation of mesoaccumbens dopamine neurons. Additionally, the multiplicity of junctions formed by 5-HT terminals on targets with or without retrograde labeling or tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity is consistent with known diverse physiological actions of 5-HT in the tegmental area.},

@article{Parent.2001,
	Abstract = {The axonal projections of the internal pallidum (GPi) in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were studied by labeling small pools of neurons with biotinylated dextran amine. Fifty-two axons were reconstructed entirely from serial sections with a camera lucida. Two types of projection neurons were identified in the GPi on the basis of their target sites. The abundant and centrally located type I neurons gave rise to a long axonal branch that descended directly to the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, where it arborized discretely. Other branches ascended to the thalamus and broke into 10-15 thinner collaterals that ran through most of the ventral anterior nucleus, where they terminated as typical plexuses. About half of these axons gave rise to collaterals that arborized in both components of the centre m{\'{e}}dian/parafascicular thalamic complex. The less numerous and peripherally located type II neurons had an axon that climbed the rostral thalamic pole, coursed along the stria medullaris, and arborized profusely within the lateral habenular nucleus, which stood out as the most densely innervated pallidal target. Some type II axons provided collaterals to the anterior thalamic nuclei. A small proportion of axons of both types had branches that crossed the midline and terminated in contralateral GPi target structures. Three-dimensional reconstruction showed that type I axons arborized principally along the sagittal plane. These data reveal that GPi neurons of type I act through a widely distributed axonal network upon thalamic and brainstem premotor neurons, whereas type II neurons act in a much more focused manner upon lateral habenular neurons.},

	Abstract = {Retrograde and anterograde tract-tracing studies were carried out to determine whether the capacity of the nucleus accumbens to influence the thalamic mediodorsal nucleus via ventral striatopallidothalamic connections disproportionately favors the shell over the core subterritory. After injections of Fluoro-Gold into the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, retrogradely labeled neurons were detected in sections also processed for calbindin-D 28-kD and neurotensin immunoreactivities to facilitate identification of subterritories in the ventral pallidum. Fluoro-Gold-labeled cells were counted in series of sections cut through the ventral pallidum, rostral globus pallidus, nucleus of the vertical limb of the diagonal band, preoptic region, lateral hypothalamus, and the sublenticular gray region, including parts of the extended amygdala. Data were expressed as cells/unit area and as percentages of all labeled forebrain cells. Mediodorsal nucleus-projecting rostroventral forebrain neurons were most numerous in the ventromedial part of the subcommissural ventral pallidum and pallidal parts of the olfactory tubercle. Few were observed in the dorsolateral part of the subcommissural ventral pallidum. In addition, following injections into the ventral pallidum, anterogradely transported biotinylated dextran amine was evaluated in sections processed for calbindin or tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivities. Injection into the ventromedial part of the subcommissural ventral pallidum resulted in robust anterograde labeling of the medial segment of the mediodorsal nucleus and ventral tegmental area and weak labeling of the substantia nigra and subthalamic nucleus. Conversely, after injection into the dorsolateral part of the subcommissural ventral pallidum, anterograde labeling was weak in the mediodorsal nucleus and ventral tegmental area, but robust in the substantia nigra and subthalamic nucleus. The results are consistent with a predominant accumbens shell influence on the mediodorsal nucleus and with cortico-ventral striatopallidal-thalamocortical pathways that begin and end in different parts of the frontal lobe.},

	Abstract = {The efferent projections of the ventral pallidum in the rat were studied using anterograde tracing of Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin and retrograde tracing of choleratoxin subunit B. The main aim of this study was to determine the degree of topographical organization in the outputs of the ventral pallidum. In the telencephalon, ventral pallidal fibers reach the prefrontal cortex, the ventral striatum, the lateral septum, the basolateral, lateral, and central amygdaloid nuclei, and the lateral entorhinal area. Diencephalic targets of ventral pallidal fibers are the lateral hypothalamus, the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, the dorsomedial part of the subthalamic nucleus, the medial part of the parafascicular nucleus and the lateral habenula. In the mesencephalon, ventral pallidal fibers terminate in the ventral tegmental area, the substantia nigra, the retrorubral area, the median raphe nucleus, the nucleus raphe magnus, the peribrachial area, the ventromedial part of the central gray substance and the locus coeruleus. The results of the experiments in which retrograde tracers were injected in different nuclei in the mesencephalon allow the distinction of two main areas in the ventral pallidum. Deposits of retrograde tracers in the substantia nigra, pars reticulata result in labeling of cells in the dorsolateral part of the ventral pallidum, located immediately ventral to the anterior limb of the anterior commissure. Retrograde tracer injections in other targets of the ventral mesencephalon, i.e. the dopaminergic cell groups A10, A9 or A8, or nuclei in the peribrachial area result in labeling of neurons in an extensive ventromedial and ventrolateral zone of the ventral pallidum. The medial part of this ventral pallidal zone projects to the ventral tegmental area, whereas ventral and lateral parts connect with more lateral and caudal mesencephalic targets. The projections from the ventral pallidum to the ventral striatum, the subthalamic nucleus and adjacent lateral hypothalamic area, and the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus are distinctly topographically organized. The ventral pallidostriatal projections preserve a medial-to-lateral, a dorsal-to-ventral and, to a lesser degree, a rostral-to-caudal topography. With respect to the subthalamic region, the dorsolateral part of the ventral pallidum projects to the dorsomedial part of the subthalamic nucleus, whereas the ventromedial and ventrolateral parts of the ventral pallidum are topographically connected with the area of the lateral hypothalamus medially adjacent to the subthalamic nucleus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

@article{Guan.1989,
	Abstract = {The effects of microinfusion of serotonin (5-HT) agents as well as glutamate and muscimol into the ventral tegmental area (VTA) on dopamine (DA) release in the ipsilateral nucleus accumbens (ACC) were investigated in freely moving rats, using a push-pull perfusion procedure. The baseline values for DA, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were approximately 0.24, 8.4, 2.1 and 2.7 pmol/15 min, respectively, in the push-pull perfusate of the ACC. When microinfused into the VTA, glutamate (0.74 microgram) significantly (p less than 0.05) increased the contents of DOPAC (110%) and HVA (90%) over baseline levels in the perfusate. On the other hand, 0.5 microgram muscimol (a gamma-amino-n-butyric acid, GABA, agonist) significantly, (p less than 0.05) decreased both DA (40%) and DOPAC (20%) levels relative to baseline values. Administration of 2 micrograms 5-HT into the VTA caused a significant (p less than 0.05) elevation in the perfusate levels of DOPAC (80%) and HVA (70%) over baseline values. A similar effect was obtained with a nonselective 5-HT1 agonist but not with a selective 5-HT1A agonist. The results suggest that 5-HT innervations in the VTA may have an excitatory action possibly via 5-HT1B rather than 5-HT1A receptors on the mesolimbic DA system projecting to the ACC and that this DA system may also be regulated by glutamatergic and GABAergic (via GABAA receptors) inputs.},

	Abstract = {The anatomical distributions and affinity states of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors were compared in the rat central nervous system using quantitative autoradiography. [3H]SCH23390 and [3H]spiperone (in the presence of 100 nM mianserin) were used to label the D1 and D2 receptors, respectively. The densities of D1 and D2 receptors displayed a positive correlation among 21 brain regions (Pearson correlation coefficient, r = 0.80, P less than 0.001). The affinity states for the D1 and D2 receptors were found to be quite different from each other, and different from the results obtained by others using homogenate preparations. Both the D1 and D2 receptors were best modeled using a two-state model. In the absence of exogenous guanine nucleotides and using the nonselective agonist dopamine as the competitor, the D1 receptor was primarily in a low affinity agonist state (RH = 21 +/- 6%), whereas the D2 receptor was primarily in the high affinity agonist state (RH = 77 +/- 3%). In the presence of 10 microM guanylyl-imidodiphosphate or guanosine-5{'}-O-(2-thiophosphate) both the D1 and the D2 receptor were completely in a low affinity agonist state (RL = 100%). These affinity states were found both in the nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle using dopamine as the competitor and in the striatum using selective D1 or D2 agonists as competitors. Receptor occupancy of the D2 receptor with either an agonist or antagonist did not alter the affinity states of the D1 receptor, and conversely, receptor occupancy of the D1 receptor did not alter the affinity states of the D2 receptor. The correlation between densities of D1 and D2 receptors provides an anatomical framework for evaluating behavioral and electrophysiological evidence of an interaction between the two dopamine receptor subtypes. This interaction does not appear to be due to a sharing or coupling of G-proteins in such a way that binding to one dopamine receptor subtype alters the affinity state of the other receptor subtype. The differences between dopamine receptor distributions described by labeled agonists and antagonists may be due in part to differences in their affinity states. The low proportion of high affinity state D1 receptors may explain some of the difficulties in assigning specific behavioral roles to the D1 receptor.},

This article summarizes the evidence and extends and updates earlier reviews. The main alternative to "unlearning" is the idea that extinction (as well as other retroactive interference processes, including counterconditioning) involves new learning that is stored along with the old. One consequence is that the Pavlovian signal or instrumental action has two available "meanings" and thus has the properties of an ambiguous word: its current meaning (and the resulting behavioral output) depends on what the current context retrieves. Contexts can be provided by a variety of background stimuli, including the physical environment, internal drug state, and time. The second thing learned (e.g., extinction, counterconditioning) seems especially dependent on the context for retrieval. A variety of evidence is consistent with this analysis, which highlights several important sources of relapse after extinction. The article concludes with several issues for future research, among them the question of how we can optimize extinction and other putative "unlearning" treatments so as to prevent the various forms of relapse discussed here.},

abstract="Both serotonin and NMDA signaling in prefrontal cortex (PFC) are implicated in mental disorders, including depression and anxiety. To understand their potential contributions to PFC neuronal excitability, we examined the effect of co-activation of 5-HT and NMDA receptors on action potential firing elicited by depolarizing current injection in PFC pyramidal neurons. In the presence of NMDA, a low concentration of the 5-HT(1A) agonist 8-OH-DPAT substantially reduced the number of spikes, and a low concentration of the 5-HT(2A/C) agonist alpha-Me-5HT significantly enhanced it, while both agonists were ineffective when applied alone. The 8-OH-DPAT effect on firing was mediated by inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA), whereas the alpha-Me-5HT effect was mediated by activation of protein kinase C (PKC). Moreover, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a signaling molecule downstream of PKA and PKC, was involved in both 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A/C) modulation of neuronal excitability. Biochemical evidence showed that 5-HT(1A) decreased, whereas 5-HT(2A/C) increased the activation of ERK in an NMDA-dependent manner. In animals exposed to acute stress, the enhancing effect of 5-HT(2A/C) on firing was lost, while the decreasing effect of 5-HT(1A) on firing was intact. Concomitantly, the effect of 5-HT(2A/C), but not 5-HT(1A), on ERK activation was abolished in stressed animals. Taken together, our results demonstrate that distinct 5-HT receptor subtypes, by interacting with NMDA receptors, differentially regulate PFC neuronal firing, and the complex effects of 5-HT receptors on excitability are selectively altered under stressful conditions, which are often associated with mental disorders.",

abstract="The orbital part of prefrontal cortex appears to be crucially involved in the motivational control of goal-directed behaviour. Patients with lesions of orbitofrontal cortex show impairments in making decisions about the expected outcome of actions. Monkeys with orbitofrontal lesions respond abnormally to changes in reward expectations and show altered reward preferences. As rewards constitute basic goals of behaviour, we investigated here how neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex of monkeys process information about liquid and food rewards in a typical frontal task, spatial delayed responding. The activity of orbitofrontal neurons increases in response to reward-predicting signals, during the expectation of rewards, and after the receipt of rewards. Neurons discriminate between different rewards, mainly irrespective of the spatial and visual features of reward-predicting stimuli and behavioural reactions. Most reward discriminations reflect the animals' relative preference among the available rewards, as expressed by their choice behaviour, rather than physical reward properties. Thus, neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex appear to process the motivational value of rewarding outcomes of voluntary action.",

abstract="The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) represents one of the most sensitive reward sites in the brain. However, the exact relationship between DRN neuronal activity and reward signaling has been elusive. In this review, we will summarize anatomical, pharmacological, optogenetics, and electrophysiological studies on the functions and circuit mechanisms of DRN neurons in reward processing. The DRN is commonly associated with serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT), but this nucleus also contains neurons of the neurotransmitter phenotypes of glutamate, GABA and dopamine. Pharmacological studies indicate that 5-HT might be involved in modulating reward- or punishment-related behaviors. Recent optogenetic stimulations demonstrate that transient activation of DRN neurons produces strong reinforcement signals that are carried out primarily by glutamate. Moreover, activation of DRN 5-HT neurons enhances reward waiting. Electrophysiological recordings reveal that the activity of DRN neurons exhibits diverse behavioral correlates in reward-related tasks. Studies so far thus demonstrate the strong power of DRN neurons in reward signaling and at the same time invite additional efforts to dissect the roles and mechanisms of different DRN neuron types in various processes of reward-related behaviors.",

abstract="The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is important for the cognitive processes of learning and decision making. Previous recordings have revealed that OFC neurons encode predictions of reward outcomes. The OFC is interconnected with the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), which is a major serotonin (5-HT) center of the brain. Recent studies have provided increasing evidence that the DRN encodes reward signals. However, it remains unclear how the activity of DRN neurons affects the prospective reward coding of OFC neurons. By combining single-unit recordings from the OFC and optogenetic activation of the DRN in behaving mice, we found that DRN stimulation is sufficient to organize and modulate the anticipatory responses of OFC neurons. During pavlovian conditioning tasks for mice, odorant cues were associated with the delayed delivery of natural rewards of sucrose solution or DRN stimulation. After training, OFC neurons exhibited prospective responses to the sucrose solution. More importantly, the coupling of an odorant with delayed DRN stimulation resulted in tonic excitation or inhibition of OFC neurons during the delay period. The intensity of the prospective responses was affected by the frequency and duration of DRN stimulation. Additionally, DRN stimulation bidirectionally modulated the prospective responses to natural rewards. These experiments indicate that signals from the DRN are incorporated into the brain reward system to shape the cortical prospective coding of rewards.",

Here we addressed this question using fibre photometry and single-unit recording from serotonin (5-HT) neurons and GABA neurons in the DRN of behaving mice. Rewards including sucrose, food, sex and social interaction rapidly activate 5-HT neurons, but aversive stimuli including quinine and footshock do not. Both expected and unexpected rewards activate 5-HT neurons. After mice learn to wait for sucrose delivery, most 5-HT neurons fire tonically during waiting and then phasically on reward acquisition. Finally, GABA neurons are activated by aversive stimuli but inhibited when mice seek rewards. Thus, DRN 5-HT neurons positively encode a wide range of reward signals during anticipatory and consummatory phases of reward responses. Moreover, GABA neurons play a complementary role in reward processing.",

abstract="The multifaceted concept of impulsivity implies that different impulsivity aspects, mediated by different neural processes, influence behavior at different levels. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key component of the neural processes regulating impulsivity. In this review, we discuss the findings of lesion studies in animals and functional imaging studies in humans focusing on the role of the NAc in impulsivity. Evidence supports that the extent and pattern of involvement of the NAc, and its subregions, the core and the shell, vary among different facets of impulsivity. Data from imaging studies reviewed in this article suggest the involvement of the ventral striatum/NAc in impulsive choice. Findings of animal studies indicate that lesions of the NAc core subregion facilitated impulsivity in tasks involving intertemporal choice, and promoted a risk-averse, less impulsive, tendency in tasks involving options with probability differences. Modification of neurotransmitter activity, especially of dopamine, which is proposed to underlie the changes observed in functional imaging studies, has been shown to influence afferent input pattern in the NAc and the generation of the behavioral output. Parameters of behavioral tasks reflecting response inhibition function are altered by neurochemical interventions and local electrical stimulation in both the core and the shell subregions. In toto, NAc's pattern of neuronal activity, either genetically determined or acquired, has a critical impact on the interindividual variation in the expression of impulsivity. Nevertheless, the NAc is not the only substrate responsible for impulsivity and it is not involved in each facet of impulsivity to the same extent.",

As a major output for limbic signals, the ventral pallidum was once associated primarily with motor functions rather than regarded as a reward structure in its own right. However, ample evidence now suggests that ventral pallidum function is a major mechanism of reward in the brain. We review data indicating that (1) an intact ventral pallidum is necessary for normal reward and motivation, (2) stimulated activation of ventral pallidum is sufficient to cause reward and motivation enhancements, and (3) activation patterns in ventral pallidum neurons specifically encode reward and motivation signals via phasic bursts of excitation to incentive and hedonic stimuli. We conclude that the ventral pallidum may serve as an important 'limbic final common pathway' for mesocorticolimbic processing of many rewards.",

A less well known fact is that the GPi also projects to the lateral habenula (LHb) which is often associated with the limbic system. Using the monkey performing a saccade task with positionally biased reward outcomes, we found that antidromically identified LHb-projecting neurons were distributed mainly in the dorsal and ventral borders of the GPi and that their activity was strongly modulated by expected reward outcomes. A majority of them were excited by the no-reward-predicting target and inhibited by the reward-predicting target. These reward-dependent modulations were similar to those in LHb neurons but started earlier than those in LHb neurons. These results suggest that GPi may initiate reward-related signals through its effects on the LHb, which then influences the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems.",

This compartmentalization is respected by many afferent and efferent projections of the striatum. The distribution of distinct types of neuroactive substances and receptors and the unique connections of the striosome and matrix suggest a functional segregation between these compartments. The present study examines the organization of efferent projections from each of the striatal compartments to the entopeduncular nucleus (EPN), a major output center of the basal ganglia. The fluorescent retrograde tracer fluorogold, or rhodamine-conjugated dextran, was injected into the lateral habenula or the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus of adult Wistar rats to identify the topographical organization of EPN-habenular and EPN-thalamic neurons. Fluorogold was then placed into the rostral or caudal parts of the EPN, identified from the previous experiment as areas containing predominantly EPN-habenular or EPN-thalamic neurons, respectively. Sections containing retrogradely labeled neurons in the neostriatum were simultaneously immunolabeled for calbindin-D28kDa, a calcium-binding protein found exclusively in the projection neurons of the matrix. The results indicate that the striatal projection to the EPN-habenular and EPN-thalamic parts of the EPN originates from striosome and matrix neurons, respectively. The duality of striatal outflow involving the EPN suggests a mechanism whereby the striosome is integrated into subcortical pathways that modulate the activity of the basal ganglia via the ascending serotoninergic projection from the dorsal raphe nucleus, whereas the matrix is involved in a loop that includes the thalamus and the cerebral cortex.",

We found three types of neuron based on responses to odours and outcomes: approximately half of the neurons (type I, 52\%) showed phasic excitation after reward-predicting odours and rewards in a manner consistent with reward prediction error coding; the other half of neurons showed persistent activity during the delay between odour and outcome that was modulated positively (type II, 31\%) or negatively (type III, 18\%) by the value of outcomes. Whereas the activity of type I neurons was sensitive to actual outcomes (that is, when the reward was delivered as expected compared to when it was unexpectedly omitted), the activity of type II and type III neurons was determined predominantly by reward-predicting odours. We 'tagged' dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons with the light-sensitive protein channelrhodopsin-2 and identified them based on their responses to optical stimulation while recording. All identified dopaminergic neurons were of type I and all GABAergic neurons were of type II. These results show that VTA GABAergic neurons signal expected reward, a key variable for dopaminergic neurons to calculate reward prediction error.",

However, the VTA projection to the PFC also contains a substantial nondopamine component, whose neurochemical phenotype is unknown. To examine if a portion of this nondopamine VTA projection contains GABA, anterograde and retrograde tract-tracing in the rat was combined with GABA immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy. Following injections of Fluoro-Gold (FG) into the PFC, many VTA neurons were retrogradely labeled, as visualized by immunoperoxidase staining for FG. A large portion of FG-labeled somata (58\%) and dendrites (33\%) within the VTA also contained immunogold-silver labeling for GABA. These dually labeled profiles exhibited a morphology similar to dopamine-containing cells within the VTA. To confirm and extend these findings, anterograde transport of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) from the VTA was combined with immunogold-silver labeling for GABA within the PFC. Consistent with the results obtained from retrograde tracing, a portion of BDA-labeled terminals in the PFC also contained immunoreactivity for GABA. These dually labeled terminals formed symmetric synapses onto small caliber dendrites and dendritic spines. Some PFC dendrites contacted by GABA-containing VTA terminals were themselves GABA-labeled. The results of this investigation have identified a substantial population of GABA-containing neurons in the VTA that send axons to the PFC where they synapse on the distal processes of both pyramidal and local circuit neurons. This GABA-containing mesocortical pathway may provide substrates for both inhibitory and disinhibitory influences on PFC neuronal activity.",

It has become increasingly clear, however, that dopamine neurons also transmit signals related to salient but nonrewarding experiences such as aversive and alerting events. Here we review recent advances in understanding the reward and nonreward functions of dopamine. Based on this data, we propose that dopamine neurons come in multiple types that are connected with distinct brain networks and have distinct roles in motivational control. Some dopamine neurons encode motivational value, supporting brain networks for seeking, evaluation, and value learning. Others encode motivational salience, supporting brain networks for orienting, cognition, and general motivation. Both types of dopamine neurons are augmented by an alerting signal involved in rapid detection of potentially important sensory cues. We hypothesize that these dopaminergic pathways for value, salience, and alerting cooperate to support adaptive behavior.",

abstract="The orbitofrontal cortex and adjacent ventromedial prefrontal cortex carry reward representations and mediate flexible behaviour when circumstances change. Here we review how recent experiments in humans and macaques have confirmed the existence of a major difference between the functions of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and adjacent medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) on the one hand and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) on the other. These differences, however, may not be best accounted for in terms of specializations for reward and error/punishment processing as is commonly assumed. Instead we argue that both lesion and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies reveal that the lOFC is concerned with the assignment of credit for both reward and error outcomes to the choice of specific stimuli and with the linking of specific stimulus representations to representations of specific types of reward outcome. By contrast, we argue that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex/mOFC is concerned with evaluation, value-guided decision-making and maintenance of a choice over successive decisions. Despite the popular view that they cause perseveration of behaviour and inability to inhibit repetition of a previously made choice, we found that lesions in neither orbitofrontal subdivision caused perseveration. On the contrary, lesions in the lOFC made animals switch more rapidly between choices when they were finding it difficult to assign reward values to choices. Lesions in the mOFC caused animals to lose their normal predisposition to repeat previously successful choices, suggesting that the mOFC does not just mediate value comparison in choice but also facilitates maintenance of the same choice if it has been successful.",

abstract="Recent data have emphasized the neurochemically distinct nature of subterritories in the accumbens part of the rat ventral striatum termed the core, shell, and rostral pole. In order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of how afferents are distributed relative to these subterritories, immunohistochemical detection of retrogradely transported Fluoro-Gold was carried out following iontophoretic injections intended to involve selectively one of the subterritories. The data revealed that a number of cortical afferents of the medial shell and core originate in separate areas, i.e., the dorsal peduncular, infralimbic, and posterior piriform cortices (to medial shell) and the dorsal prelimbic, anterior agranular insular, anterior cingulate, and perirhinal cortices (to core). The lateral shell and rostral pole are innervated by cortical structures that also project either to the medial shell or core. The orbital, posterior agranular insular, and entorhinal cortices, hippocampus, and basal amygdala were observed to innervate the accumbens in a topographic manner. Following core injections, strong bilateral cortical labeling was observed. Few labeled cortical cells were observed contralaterally following injections in the medial shell. Intermediate numbers of labeled neurons were observed in contralateral cortices following lateral shell injections. Robust subcortical labeling in a variety of structures in the ventral forebrain, lateral hypothalamus, deep temporal lobe, and brainstem was observed after shell injections, particularly those that involved the caudal dorsomedial extremity of the shell, i.e., its ``septal pole.'' Selective ipsilateral labeling of subcortical structures in the basal ganglia circuitry was observed following injections in the core and, to a lesser extent, lateral shell. It was concluded that a number of afferent systems exhibit varying degrees of segregation with respect to the accumbal subterritories.",

abstract="The central medial nucleus (CM) of thalamus is a prominent cell group of the rostral intralaminar complex of the thalamus. No previous report in the rat has comprehensively described the projections of CM. Using the anterograde anatomical tracer, Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin, we examined the efferent projections of CM, comparing projections from rostral (CMr) and caudal (CMc) regions of CM. We showed that the central medial nucleus distributes substantially to several cortical sites and to a limited number of subcortical structures. The primary CM targets were anterior and posterior regions of cortex, the claustrum, the caudate-putamen, the nucleus accumbens (ACC), the olfactory tubercle, and the amygdala. CMr and CMc distribute to several of the same structures but essentially to different parts of these structures. By comparison, CMr more strongly targets limbic structures, CMc more heavily sensorimotor structures. Main CMr projection sites were the medial agranular, anterior cingulate, prelimbic, dorsolateral orbital and dorsal agranular insular cortices, the dorsal striatum, the ACC, and the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala. Main CMc cortical projection sites were the ventrolateral, lateral and dorsolateral orbital cortices, dorsal, ventral and posterior agranular insular cortices, visceral cortex, primary somatosensory and motor cortices, and perirhinal cortex. Main CMc subcortical projection sites were the dorsal striatum and the lateral, central, anterior cortical, and basomedial nuclei of amygdala. The largely complementary output of CMr and CMc to diverse areas of cortex and to regions of the striatum and amygdala suggest a combined CM influence over a widespread area of the anterior cortex and throughout the dorsal and ventral striatum and the amygdala. CM projections to limbic and sensorimotor structures of the rostral forebrain suggest that CM may serve to integrate affective, cognitive and sensorimotor functions for goal-directed behavior.",

abstract="Many of the brain's reward systems converge on the nucleus accumbens, a region richly innervated by excitatory, inhibitory, and modulatory afferents representing the circuitry necessary for selecting adaptive motivated behaviors. The ventral subiculum of the hippocampus provides contextual and spatial information, the basolateral amygdala conveys affective influence, and the prefrontal cortex provides an integrative impact on goal-directed behavior. The balance of these afferents is under the modulatory influence of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area. This midbrain region receives its own complex mix of excitatory and inhibitory inputs, some of which have only recently been identified. Such afferent regulation positions the dopamine system to bias goal-directed behavior based on internal drives and environmental contingencies. Conditions that result in reward promote phasic dopamine release, which serves to maintain ongoing behavior by selectively potentiating ventral subicular drive to the accumbens. Behaviors that fail to produce an expected reward decrease dopamine transmission, which favors prefrontal cortical-driven switching to new behavioral strategies. As such, the limbic reward system is designed to optimize action plans for maximizing reward outcomes. This system can be commandeered by drugs of abuse or psychiatric disorders, resulting in inappropriate behaviors that sustain failed reward strategies. A fuller appreciation of the circuitry interconnecting the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area should serve to advance discovery of new treatment options for these conditions.",

The tVTA/RMTg sends dense GABA projections to VTA and substantia nigra neurons. The inhibitory influence of tVTA/RMTg on dopamine neurons is supported by both neuroanatomical and electrophysiology data. The latter studies also reveal the tVTA/RMTg as a substrate for morphine and cannabinoid action on dopamine cells. In primates, the tVTA/RMTg has been implicated in reward prediction error signals, through a basal ganglia-lateral habenula-tVTA/RMTg-dopamine-basal ganglia circuit. In rodents, the tVTA/RMTg has been shown to play a critical role in aversive behaviors, particularly those involving behavioral inhibition, such as freezing and avoidance.

Although recent studies have shown how dopamine neurons respond to rewards and sensory stimuli predicting reward, it is unclear which parts of the brain provide dopamine neurons with signals necessary for these actions. Here we show that the primate lateral habenula, part of the structure called the epithalamus, is a major candidate for a source of negative reward-related signals in dopamine neurons. We recorded the activity of habenula neurons and dopamine neurons while rhesus monkeys were performing a visually guided saccade task with positionally biased reward outcomes. Many habenula neurons were excited by a no-reward-predicting target and inhibited by a reward-predicting target. In contrast, dopamine neurons were excited and inhibited by reward-predicting and no-reward-predicting targets, respectively. Each time the rewarded and unrewarded positions were reversed, both habenula and dopamine neurons reversed their responses as the bias in saccade latency reversed. In unrewarded trials, the excitation of habenula neurons started earlier than the inhibition of dopamine neurons. Furthermore, weak electrical stimulation of the lateral habenula elicited strong inhibitions in dopamine neurons. These results suggest that the inhibitory input from the lateral habenula plays an important role in determining the reward-related activity of dopamine neurons.",

abstract="The lateral habenula (LHb) has recently been identified as a key regulator of the reward system by driving inhibition onto dopaminergic neurons. However, the nature and potential modulation of the major input to the LHb originating from the basal ganglia are poorly understood. Although the output of the basal ganglia is thought to be primarily inhibitory, here we show that transmission from the basal ganglia to the LHb is excitatory, glutamatergic, and suppressed by serotonin. Behaviorally, activation of this pathway is aversive, consistent with its role as an ``antireward'' signal. Our demonstration of an excitatory projection from the basal ganglia to the LHb explains how LHb-projecting basal ganglia neurons can have similar encoding properties as LHb neurons themselves. Our results also provide a link between antireward excitatory synapses and serotonin,?a neuromodulator implicated in depression.",

Lateral habenula (LHb) is considered as a negative reward source and it is reported that stimulation of the LHb rapidly induces inhibition of firing in midbrain dopamine neurons. Interestingly, the phasic fall in LHb neuronal activity may follow the excitation of dopamine neurons in response to reward-predicting stimuli. The VTA and SNpc give rise to dopaminergic projections that innervate the LHb, which is also known to be involved in processing painful stimuli. But it's unclear what physiological effects these inputs have on habenular function. In this study we distinguished the LHb pain-activated neurons of the Wistar rats and assessed their electrophysiological responsiveness to the stimulation of the VTA and SNpc with either single-pulse stimulation (300 {\textmu}A, 0.5 Hz) or tetanic stimulation (80 {\textmu}A, 25 Hz). Single-pulse stimulation that was delivered to either midbrain structure triggered transient inhibition of firing of ?90\% of the LHb pain-activated neurons. However, tetanic stimulation of the VTA tended to evoke an elevation in neuronal firing rate. We conclude that LHb pain-activated neurons can receive diverse reward-related signals originating from midbrain dopaminergic structures, and thus participate in the regulation of the brain reward system via both positive and negative feedback mechanisms.",

We found that lateral habenula and dopamine neurons accessed two distinct reward memories: a short-timescale memory expressed at the start of the task and a near-optimal long-timescale memory expressed when a future reward outcome was revealed. The short- and long-timescale memories were expressed in different forms of reward-oriented eye movements.

Yet LHb neurons are largely glutamatergic, indicating that this inhibition may occur through an intermediate structure. Recent studies in rats have suggested a candidate for this role, the GABAergic rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), but this neural pathway has not yet been tested directly. We now show using electrophysiology and anatomic tracing that (1) the monkey has an inhibitory structure similar to the rat RMTg; (2) RMTg neurons receive excitatory input from the LHb, exhibit negative reward-prediction errors, and send axonal projections near DA soma; and (3) stimulating this structure inhibits DA neurons. Surprisingly, some RMTg neurons responded to reward cues earlier than the LHb, and carry ``state-value'' signals not found in DA neurons. Thus, our data suggest that the RMTg translates LHb reward-prediction errors (negative) into DA reward-prediction errors (positive), while transmitting additional motivational signals to non-DA networks.",

abstract="The mammalian neostriatum is divisible into neurochemically and cytoarchitectonically distinct striosome and matrix compartments. This compartmentalization is respected by many afferent and efferent projections of the striatum. The distribution of distinct types of neuroactive substances and receptors and the unique connections of the striosome and matrix suggest a functional segregation between these compartments. The present study examines the organization of efferent projections from each of the striatal compartments to the entopeduncular nucleus (EPN), a major output center of the basal ganglia. The fluorescent retrograde tracer fluorogold, or rhodamine-conjugated dextran, was injected into the lateral habenula or the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus of adult Wistar rats to identify the topographical organization of EPN-habenular and EPN-thalamic neurons. Fluorogold was then placed into the rostral or caudal parts of the EPN, identified from the previous experiment as areas containing predominantly EPN-habenular or EPN-thalamic neurons, respectively. Sections containing retrogradely labeled neurons in the neostriatum were simultaneously immunolabeled for calbindin-D28kDa, a calcium-binding protein found exclusively in the projection neurons of the matrix. The results indicate that the striatal projection to the EPN-habenular and EPN-thalamic parts of the EPN originates from striosome and matrix neurons, respectively. The duality of striatal outflow involving the EPN suggests a mechanism whereby the striosome is integrated into subcortical pathways that modulate the activity of the basal ganglia via the ascending serotoninergic projection from the dorsal raphe nucleus, whereas the matrix is involved in a loop that includes the thalamus and the cerebral cortex.",

In order to study the influence of the habenula on dopaminergic activity, single-cell electrophysiological techniques were used to record unit discharge of dopamine-containing neurons in the SNC and VTA during electrical stimulation of the LHb or adjacent structures. Dopamine-containing neurons in the SNC and VTA were identified by their characteristic spike duration (greater than 2 msec), discharge rate (2-8 spikes/sec), and irregular firing pattern. Analysis of peristimulus time histograms showed that 85\% of SNC cells and 91\% of VTA neurons were inhibited after single pulse stimulation (0.25 mA, 0.1 msec) of the LHb. The mean time between stimulation and onset of inhibition was 11 msec (range, 2-22 msec) and mean duration of maximal suppression was 76 msec (range, 20-250 msec). Stimulation of structures adjacent to the LHb (hippocampus, lateral thalamus, medial dorsal thalamus, medial habenula) had little or no effect. Destruction of the fasciculus retroflexus, the fiber pathway that contains most habenular efferents, blocked the stimulation effects on dopamine-containing neurons. Destruction of the stria medullaris, which contains most habenular afferents, did not alter the inhibitory effect of habenular stimulation. Injection of a cytotoxin, kainic acid, in the LHb 1 week before recording sessions blocked the inhibitory consequences of habenular stimulation. These experiments show that activation of neuronal perikarya in the LHb causes orthodromic inhibition of dopamine-containing neurons in SNC and VTA via the fasciculus retroflexus.",

Although considerable attention has been devoted to the mechanisms contributing to phasic increases in dopamine activity, less is known about the origin of the transient cessation in firing accompanying the unexpected loss of a predicted reward. Recent studies suggesting that the lateral habenula (LHb) may contribute to this type of signaling in humans prompted us to evaluate the effects of LHb stimulation on the activity of dopamine and non-dopamine neurons of the anesthetized rat. Single-pulse stimulation of the LHb (0.5 mA, 100 micros) transiently suppressed the activity of 97\% of the dopamine neurons recorded in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area. The duration of the cessation averaged approximately 85 ms and did not differ between the two regions. Identical stimuli transiently excited 52\% of the non-dopamine neurons in the ventral midbrain. Electrolytic lesions of the fasciculus retroflexus blocked the effects of LHb stimulation on dopamine neurons. Local application of bicuculline but not the SK-channel blocker apamin attenuated the effects of LHb stimulation on dopamine cells, indicating that the response is mediated by GABA(A) receptors. These data suggest that LHb-induced suppression of dopamine cell activity is mediated indirectly by orthodromic activation of putative GABAergic neurons in the ventral midbrain. The habenulomesencephalic pathway, which is capable of transiently suppressing the activity of dopamine neurons at a population level, may represent an important component of the circuitry involved in encoding reward expectancy.",

The administration of apomorphine (2 mg/kg) resulted in an excitation of individual LHb neurons. On average, the spontaneous action potential firing of the LHb neurons was increased by 39\%. However, the apomorphine effect showed marked topographic differences within the LHb. Particularly, a small subset of neurons in the lateral division of the LHb, which was localized within the oval subnucleus, showed an apomorphine-mediated increase in discharge frequency by 96\%. In contrast, spontaneous discharge of neurons within other areas of the lateral division was not modified. Likewise, within the medial division of the LHb, a region that preferentially receives projections from dopaminergic midbrain nuclei, the majority of neurons failed to show apomorphine-mediated alterations in action potential firing. However, within the superior subnucleus of this division, an area with yet unclear afferent supply, spontaneous neuronal firing was enhanced by 56\%. The apomorphine-mediated excitation of LHb neurons was antagonized by coapplication of haloperidol (2 mg/kg), which alone did not alter spontaneous action potential firing of individual LHb neurons. The present study demonstrates that spontaneous activity of distinct subsets of neurons within the LHb is strongly enhanced by systemic activation of dopaminergic receptors. Despite the small sample size, the data suggest that this dopaminergic modulation shows a topographic specificity. Therefore, the results support the hypothesis of a functional subnuclear organization of the rat habenular complex.",

abstract="Homeostasis describes the fundamental biological ability of individuals to maintain stable internal conditions in a changing environment. Homeostatic reactions include internal adjustments as well as behavioral responses. In vertebrates, behavioral responses are induced by the reward system. This system originates in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and leads to increased dopamine levels in the forebrain whenever activated. A major inhibitor of VTA activity is the lateral habenula (LHb). This epithalamic structure is able to almost completely suppress dopamine release, either directly or via the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), when rewarding expectations are not met. A major input to the LHb arises from the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), an important regulator of the homeostatic system. Currently, little is known about the effects of the strong hypothalamic projection on the activity of LHb neurons. In the present study, we analyze neurotransmitters and cellular targets of the LHA-LHb projection in the rat. Therefore, anterograde tracing from the LHA was combined with the visualization of neurotransmitters in the LHb. These experiments revealed a mainly glutamatergic projection, probably exerting excitatory effects on the targeted LHb cells. These cellular targets were analyzed in a second step. Anterograde tracing from the LHA in combination with retrograde tracing from the VTA/RMTg region revealed that LHb neurons projecting to the VTA/RMTg region are densely targeted by the LHA projection. Visualization of synaptophysin at these contact sites indicates that the contact sites indeed are synapses. Taken together, the present study describes a strong mainly glutamatergic projection from the LHA that targets VTA/RMTg-projecting neurons in the LHb. These findings emphasize the potential role of the LHb as direct link between homeostatic areas and reward circuitries, which may be important for the control of homeostatic behaviors.",

Some labeled cells also occur in corresponding regions contralaterally. The contribution of these limbic structures to the innervation of habenula is thus strikingly similar in the three groups. In contrast, significant species variations are found in respect to pallidal afferents. Whereas the entopeduncular nucleus in rat stands out as the main source of forebrain habenular afferents, the same structure in cat appears to contribute less substantially than adjoining lateral hypothalamus to the innervation of habenula. In monkey habenular afferents also arise principally from lateral hypothalamic neurons. At pallidal levels, labeled cells are nevertheless abundant in the rostral pole of primate internal pallidum. More caudally, they are found in significant number along internal and accessory medullary laminae where they intermingle with acetylcholinesterase-containing neurons which do not themselves project significantly upon habenula. This heterogeneous distribution of labeled pallidal cells indicates that the pallidohabenular projections in primate may arise, at least in part, from specific neuronal subpopulations within internal pallidum.",

The main aim of this study was to determine the degree of topographical organization in the outputs of the ventral pallidum. In the telencephalon, ventral pallidal fibers reach the prefrontal cortex, the ventral striatum, the lateral septum, the basolateral, lateral, and central amygdaloid nuclei, and the lateral entorhinal area. Diencephalic targets of ventral pallidal fibers are the lateral hypothalamus, the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, the dorsomedial part of the subthalamic nucleus, the medial part of the parafascicular nucleus and the lateral habenula. In the mesencephalon, ventral pallidal fibers terminate in the ventral tegmental area, the substantia nigra, the retrorubral area, the median raphe nucleus, the nucleus raphe magnus, the peribrachial area, the ventromedial part of the central gray substance and the locus coeruleus. The results of the experiments in which retrograde tracers were injected in different nuclei in the mesencephalon allow the distinction of two main areas in the ventral pallidum. Deposits of retrograde tracers in the substantia nigra, pars reticulata result in labeling of cells in the dorsolateral part of the ventral pallidum, located immediately ventral to the anterior limb of the anterior commissure. Retrograde tracer injections in other targets of the ventral mesencephalon, i.e. the dopaminergic cell groups A10, A9 or A8, or nuclei in the peribrachial area result in labeling of neurons in an extensive ventromedial and ventrolateral zone of the ventral pallidum. The medial part of this ventral pallidal zone projects to the ventral tegmental area, whereas ventral and lateral parts connect with more lateral and caudal mesencephalic targets. The projections from the ventral pallidum to the ventral striatum, the subthalamic nucleus and adjacent lateral hypothalamic area, and the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus are distinctly topographically organized. The ventral pallidostriatal projections preserve a medial-to-lateral, a dorsal-to-ventral and, to a lesser degree, a rostral-to-caudal topography. With respect to the subthalamic region, the dorsolateral part of the ventral pallidum projects to the dorsomedial part of the subthalamic nucleus, whereas the ventromedial and ventrolateral parts of the ventral pallidum are topographically connected with the area of the lateral hypothalamus medially adjacent to the subthalamic nucleus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

abstract="The basal ganglia are often conceptualised as three parallel domains that include all the constituent nuclei. The 'ventral domain' appears to be critical for learning flexible behaviours for exploration and foraging, as it is the recipient of converging inputs from amygdala, hippocampal formation and prefrontal cortex, putatively centres for stimulus evaluation, spatial navigation, and planning/contingency, respectively. However, compared to work on the dorsal domains, the rich potential for quantitative theories and models of the ventral domain remains largely untapped, and the purpose of this review is to provide the stimulus for this work. We systematically review the ventral domain's structures and internal organisation, and propose a functional architecture as the basis for computational models. Using a full schematic of the structure of inputs to the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens core and shell), we argue for the existence of many identifiable processing channels on the basis of unique combinations of afferent inputs. We then identify the potential information represented in these channels by reconciling a broad range of studies from the hippocampal, amygdala and prefrontal cortex literatures with known properties of the ventral striatum from lesion, pharmacological, and electrophysiological studies. Dopamine's key role in learning is reviewed within the three current major computational frameworks; we also show that the shell-based basal ganglia sub-circuits are well placed to generate the phasic burst and dip responses of dopaminergic neurons. We detail dopamine's modulation of ventral basal ganglia's inputs by its actions on pre-synaptic terminals and post-synaptic membranes in the striatum, arguing that the complexity of these effects hint at computational roles for dopamine beyond current ideas. The ventral basal ganglia are revealed as a constellation of multiple functional systems for the learning and selection of flexible behaviours and of behavioural strategies, sharing the common operations of selection-by-disinhibition and of dopaminergic modulation.",

abstract="The dorsal raphe nucleus through its extensive efferents has been implicated in a great variety of physiological and behavioural functions. However, little is know about its afferents. Therefore, to identify the systems likely to influence the activity of serotonergic neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus, we re-examined the forebrain afferents to the dorsal raphe nucleus using cholera toxin b subunit and Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin as retrograde or anterograde tracers. With small cholera toxin b subunit injection sites, we further determined the specific afferents to the ventral and dorsal parts of the central dorsal raphe nucleus, the rostral dorsal raphe nucleus and the lateral wings. In agreement with previous studies, we observed a large number of retrogradely-labelled cells in the lateral habenula following injections in all subdivisions of the dorsal raphe nucleus. In addition, depending on the subdivision of the dorsal raphe nucleus injected, we observed a small to large number of retrogradely-labelled cells in the orbital, cingulate, infralimbic, dorsal peduncular, and insular cortice, a moderate or substantial number in the ventral pallidum and a small to substantial number in the claustrum. In addition, we observed a substantial to large number of cells in the medial and lateral preoptic areas and the medial preoptic nucleus after cholera toxin b subunit injections in the dorsal raphe nucleus excepting for those located in the ventral part of the central dorsal raphe nucleus, after which we found a moderate number of retrogradely-labelled cells. Following cholera toxin b subunit injections in the dorsal part of the central dorsal raphe nucleus, a large number of retrogradely-labelled cells was seen in the lateral, ventral and medial parts of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis whereas only a small to moderate number was visualized after injections in the other dorsal raphe nucleus subdivisions. In addition, respectively, a substantial and a moderate number of retrogradely-labelled cells was distributed in the zona incerta and the subincertal nucleus following all tracer injections in the dorsal raphe nucleus. A large number of retrogradely-labelled cells was also visualized in the lateral, dorsal and posterior hypothalamic areas and the perifornical nucleus after cholera toxin b subunit injections in the dorsal part of the central raphe nucleus and to a lesser extent following injections in the other subdivisions. We further observed a substantial to large number of retrogradely-labelled cells in the tuber cinereum and the medial tuberal nucleus following cholera toxin b subunit injections in the dorsal part of the central dorsal raphe nucleus or the lateral wings and a small to moderate number after injections in the two other dorsal raphe nucleus subdivisions. A moderate or substantial number of labelled cells was also seen in the ventromedial hypothalamic area and the arcuate nucleus following cholera toxin injections in the dorsal part of the central dorsal raphe nucleus and the lateral wings and an occasional or small number with injection sites located in the other subdivisions. Finally, we observed, respectively, a moderate and a substantial number of retrogradely-labelled cells in the central nucleus of the amygdala following tracer injections in the ventral or dorsal parts of the central dorsal raphe nucleus and a small number after injections in the other subnuclei. In agreement with these retrograde data, we visualized anterogradely-labelled fibres heterogeneously distributed in the dorsal raphe nucleus following Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin injections in the lateral orbital or infralimbic cortice, the lateral preoptic area, the perifornical nucleus, the lateral or posterior hypothalamic areas, the zona incerta, the subincertal nucleus or the medial tuberal nucleus.

abstract="It is well established that serotonergic (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) fibers, mainly originating from the dorsal and median raphe nuclei of the brainstem, distribute throughout the forebrain, most heavily to 'limbic' forebrain structures. Few reports have examined the distribution of 5-HT fibers to the thalamus and none to our knowledge using immunoprocedures for the detection of the serotonin transporter (SERT)-a very sensitive marker for 5-HT fibers. Using immunohistochemical methods for SERT, we examined the pattern of distribution of 5-HT fibers to the thalamus in the rat. We show that serotonergic fibers are heavily concentrated in midline, intralaminar and association nuclei of the thalamus, and with the exception of the lateral geniculate complex, weakly distributed to principal nuclei of thalamus. Specifically, we demonstrate that 5-HT fibers are densely concentrated in the anteroventral, anteromedial and interanteromedial nuclei of the anterior thalamus, the paraventricular, rhomboid and reuniens nuclei of the midline thalamus, the central medial and central lateral nuclei of the intralaminar thalamus, the intermediodorsal nucleus, the lateral dorsal nucleus, and the dorsal and ventral lateral geniculate nuclei and intergeniculate leaflet of the LGN complex. Less densely innervated sites include the mediodorsal, paracentral, parafascicular, lateral posterior and submedial nuclei of thalamus. Remaining regions of the thalamus, largely consisting of principal nuclei, contained few 5-HT fibers. This pattern of 5-HT innervation indicates that serotonin/ serotonergic fibers mainly affect thalamic nuclei with connections to 'non-principal' or limbic regions of the cortex (or forebrain). This suggests that serotonergic fibers to the thalamus may exert a significant influence on affective and cognitive functions, possibly complementing the actions of 5-HT fibers to other parts of the brain involved in emotional and cognitive behaviors.",

The mechanism by which electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) achieve their antidepressant effects may involve changes in PFC activity. It is, however, still unclear whether these changes are accompanied by increased synaptic availability of serotonin (5-HT). In the present study, 5-HT efflux in the rat ventral hippocampus and amygdala was analyzed using in vivo microdialysis during low-current electrical stimulation of PFC and other cortical regions. Electrical stimulation of the medial PFC produced current-dependent increases in limbic 5-HT output in both urethane-anesthetized and behaving rats. No effects on 5-HT levels were seen after comparable stimulation of either the lateral parts of the PFC, the medial precentral area, the primary motor cortex or the parietal cortex. This pronounced regional specificity of the effect of medial PFC stimulation on limbic 5-HT output suggests that activation of this particular area might play a crucial role in such antidepressant treatments as ECT and TMS.",

abstract="Serotonin (5-HT) is an important player in decision making. Serotonergic antidepressant, anxiolytic and antipsychotic drugs are extensively used in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by impaired decision making, and exert both beneficial and harmful effects in patients. Detailed insight into the serotonergic mechanisms underlying decision making is needed to strengthen the first and weaken the latter. Although much remains to be done to achieve this, accumulating studies begin to deliver a coherent view. Thus, high central 5-HT levels are generally associated with improved reversal learning, improved attentional set shifting, decreased delay discounting, and increased response inhibition, but a failure to use outcome representations. Based on 5-HT's evolutionary role, I hypothesize that 5-HT integrates expected, or changes in, relevant sensory and emotional internal/external information, leading to vigilance behaviour affecting various decision making processes. 5-HT receptor subtypes play distinctive roles in decision making. 5-HT(2A) agonists and 5-HT2c antagonists decrease compulsivity, whereas 5-HT(2A) antagonists and 5-HT(2C) agonists decrease impulsivity. 5-HT(6) antagonists univocally affect decision making processes.",

We therefore generated a comprehensive whole-brain atlas defining the monosynaptic inputs onto forebrain-projecting serotonergic neurons of dorsal versus median raphe based on a genetically restricted transsynaptic retrograde tracing strategy. We identified discrete inputs onto serotonergic neurons from forebrain and brainstem neurons, with specific inputs from hypothalamus, cortex, basal ganglia, and midbrain, displaying a greater than anticipated complexity and diversity in cell-type-specific connectivity. We identified and functionally confirmed monosynaptic glutamatergic inputs from prefrontal cortex and lateral habenula onto serotonergic neurons as well as a direct GABAergic input from striatal projection neurons. In summary, our findings emphasize the role of hyperdirect inputs to serotonergic neurons. Cell-type-specific classification of connectivity patterns will allow for further functional analysis of the diverse but specific inputs that control serotonergic neurons during behavior.",

Then, we compared these data with inputs to dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). We found that DR serotonin neurons receive inputs from a remarkably similar set of areas as VTA dopamine neurons apart from the striatum, which preferentially targets dopamine neurons.

abstract="The presence of a dopaminergic innervation of the cat lateral habenula and its possible role in modulating serotonin transmission within the basal ganglia were investigated using both in vitro and in vivo approaches. A high density of [3H]spiroperidol binding sites with similar affinities for domperidone and apomorphine as those present in the cat striatum were found in the habenula. By means of the push-pull cannula technique, a substantial release of [3H]dopamine continuously formed from [3H]tyrosine was detected in the lateral habenula of halothane-anesthetized cats since the amount of [3H]catecholamines was enhanced in the presence of benztropine, an inhibitor of dopamine uptake into dopaminergic nerve terminals. Furthermore, in anesthetized animals with a push-pull cannula implanted in each caudate nucleus and substantia nigra habenular applications of dopamine (10(-7) M) reduced nigral but not striatal release of [3H]serotonin continuously formed from [3H]tryptophan. This change was prevented either by the delivery of domperidone to the lateral habenula or by the blockade of GABAergic transmission (picrotoxin 10(-5) M) in the dorsal raphe. These data support the involvement of habenulo-raphe pathways in the regulation of serotonin transmission in the cat basal ganglia and indicate that dopaminergic inputs to the lateral habenula participate in such a control.",

Here, we used an optogenetic approach to study the effect of 5-HT on single-unit activity in the mouse primary olfactory (anterior piriform) cortex. We show that activation of DRN 5-HT neurons rapidly inhibits the spontaneous firing of olfactory cortical neurons, acting in a divisive manner, but entirely spares sensory-driven firing. These results identify a new role for serotonergic modulation in dynamically regulating the balance between different sources of neural activity in sensory systems, suggesting a possible role for 5-HT in perceptual inference.",

Present experiments suggest that dopaminergic neurons localized in the posteromedial ventral tegmental area (VTA) and central linear nucleus raphe selectively project to the ventromedial striatum (medial olfactory tubercle and medial nucleus accumbens shell), whereas the anteromedial VTA has few if any projections to the ventral striatum, and the lateral VTA largely projects to the ventrolateral striatum (accumbens core, lateral shell and lateral tubercle). These findings complement the recent behavioral findings that cocaine and amphetamine are more rewarding when administered into the ventromedial striatum than into the ventrolateral striatum. Drugs such as nicotine and opiates are more rewarding when administered into the posterior VTA or the central linear nucleus than into the anterior VTA. A review of the literature suggests that (1) the midbrain has corresponding zones for the accumbens core and medial shell; (2) the striatal portion of the olfactory tubercle is a ventral extension of the nucleus accumbens shell; and (3) a model of two dopamine projection systems from the ventral midbrain to the ventral striatum is useful for understanding reward function. The medial projection system is important in the regulation of arousal characterized by affect and drive and plays a different role in goal-directed learning than the lateral projection system, as described in the variation-selection hypothesis of striatal functional organization.",

abstract="The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is believed to be involved in schizophrenia, depression, and other disorders that display affective components. The neuronal activity of the BLA, and BLA-mediated affective behaviors, are driven by sensory stimuli transmitted in part from sensory association cortical regions. These same behaviors may be regulated by prefrontal cortical (PFC) inputs to the BLA. However, it is unclear how two sets of glutamatergic inputs to the BLA can impose opposing actions on BLA-mediated behaviors; specifically, it is unclear how PFC inputs exert inhibitory actions over BLA projection neurons. Dopamine (DA) receptor activation enhances BLA-mediated behaviors. Although we have demonstrated that DA suppresses medial PFC inputs to the BLA and enhances sensory cortical inputs, the precise cellular mechanisms for its actions are unknown. In this study we use in vivo intracellular recordings to determine the means by which glutamatergic inputs from the PFC inhibit BLA projection neurons, contrast that with glutamatergic inputs from the association sensory cortex (Te3) that drive BLA projection neurons, and examine the effects of DA receptor activation on neuronal excitability, spontaneous postsynaptic potentials (PSPs), and PFC-evoked PSPs. We found that PFC stimulation inhibits BLA projection neurons by three mechanisms: chloride-mediated hyperpolarization, a persistent decrease in neuronal input resistance, and shunting of PSPs; all effects are possibly attributable to recruitment of inhibitory interneurons. DA receptor activation enhanced neuronal input resistance by a postsynaptic mechanism (via DA D2 receptors), suppressed spontaneously occurring and PFC-evoked PSPs (via DA D1 receptors), and enhanced Te3-evoked PSPs.",

Previous recordings have revealed that OFC neurons encode predictions of reward outcomes. The OFC is interconnected with the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), which is a major serotonin (5-HT) center of the brain. Recent studies have provided increasing evidence that the DRN encodes reward signals. However, it remains unclear how the activity of DRN neurons affects the prospective reward coding of OFC neurons. By combining single-unit recordings from the OFC and optogenetic activation of the DRN in behaving mice, we found that DRN stimulation is sufficient to organize and modulate the anticipatory responses of OFC neurons. During pavlovian conditioning tasks for mice, odorant cues were associated with the delayed delivery of natural rewards of sucrose solution or DRN stimulation. After training, OFC neurons exhibited prospective responses to the sucrose solution. More importantly, the coupling of an odorant with delayed DRN stimulation resulted in tonic excitation or inhibition of OFC neurons during the delay period. The intensity of the prospective responses was affected by the frequency and duration of DRN stimulation. Additionally, DRN stimulation bidirectionally modulated the prospective responses to natural rewards. These experiments indicate that signals from the DRN are incorporated into the brain reward system to shape the cortical prospective coding of rewards.",

In addition, we also found that D1 activation and D2 inactivation in the NAcc produced behaviorally selective effects (learning versus set shifting of response strategy) that correspond to specific afferents. These results suggest that the dynamics of DA release regulate the balance between limbic and cortical drive through activation and inactivation of DA receptor subtypes in the accumbens, and this regulates goal-directed behavior.",

abstract="The nucleus accumbens (NAc), a major component of the mesolimbic system, is involved in the mediation of reinforcing and addictive properties of many dependence-producing drugs. Glutamatergic synapses within the NAc can express plasticity, including a form of endocannabinoid (eCB)-long-term depression (LTD). Recent evidences demonstrate cross talk between eCB signaling pathways and those of other receptor systems, including serotonin (5-HT); the extensive colocalization of CB1 and 5-HT receptors within the NAc suggests the potential for interplay between them. In the present study, we found that 20-min low-frequency (4 Hz) stimulation (LFS-4Hz) of glutamatergic afferences in rat brain slices induces a novel form of eCB-LTD in the NAc core, which requires 5-HT2 and CB1 receptor activation and L-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel opening. Moreover, we found that exogenous 5-HT application (5 $\mu$M, 20 min) induces an analogous LTD (5-HT-LTD) at the same synapses, requiring the activation of the same receptors and the opening of the same Ca(2+) channels; LFS-4Hz-LTD and 5-HT-LTD were mutually occlusive. Present results suggest that LFS-4Hz induces the release of 5-HT, which acts at 5-HT2 postsynaptic receptors, increasing Ca(2+) influx through L-type voltage-gated channels and 2-arachidonoylglycerol production and release; the eCB travels retrogradely and binds to presynaptic CB1 receptors, causing a long-lasting decrease of glutamate release, resulting in LTD. These observations might be helpful to understand the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying drug addiction, major depression, and other psychiatric disorders characterized by dysfunction of 5-HT neurotransmission in the NAc.",

Observations based on anterograde transport of the enzyme were exploited to determine the course of the intrinsic connections. The HRP was injected stereotactically by means of iontophoresis. Most of the amygdaloid nuclei were selectively injected, and all but a few were reached by more than one approach. The vast majority of corticoamygdaloid fibers was found to originate in cortical areas defined as allocortical (Stephan, '75). From the medial frontal cortex the central amygdaloid nucleus (AC) receives a hitherto undescribed projection originating in the tenia tecta; and both the AC and the lateral amygdaloid nucleus (AL) receive fibers from the prelimbic and infralimbic areas. The anterior cingulate area entertains a weak connection with the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus (BL). As to the insular cortex, the posterior agranular insular area projects to all amygdaloid subdivisions; the BL, AC, and the anterior cortical nucleus (COa) receive, in addition, fibers from the ventral agranular area. The prepyriform cortex connects with the entire amygdala except the medial nucleus (Am). The amygdala receives afferents from a transitional area between the amygdala and the entorhinal area. The entorhinal area proper is related to the amygdala via projections from the ventral part of the lateral entorhinal area to the AL and from the dorsal part of the lateral entorhinal area to the BL. The former nucleus also receives fibers from the perirhinal region. Additional amygdalopetal connections from the hippocampal region include a previously undescribed projection from the temporal two-thirds of CA1 to the AL and BL and to the posterior cortical nucleus (COp) with the adjacent periamygdaloid cortex (PAC). The subiculum projections to the AL, and more modestly to other amygdaloid nuclei.

abstract="Pharmacological experiments have shown that the modulation of brain serotonin levels has a strong impact on value-based decision making. Anatomical and physiological evidence also revealed that the dorsal raph{\'e} nucleus (DRN), a major source of serotonin, and the dopamine system receive common inputs from brain regions associated with appetitive and aversive information processing. The serotonin and dopamine systems also have reciprocal functional influences on each other. However, the specific mechanism by which serotonin affects value-based decision making is not clear. To understand the information carried by the DRN for reward-seeking behavior, we measured single neuron activity in the primate DRN during the performance of saccade tasks to obtain different amounts of a reward. We found that DRN neuronal activity was characterized by tonic modulation that was altered by the expected and received reward value. Consistent reward-dependent modulation across different task periods suggested that DRN activity kept track of the reward value throughout a trial. The DRN was also characterized by modulation of its activity in the opposite direction by different neuronal subgroups, one firing strongly for the prediction and receipt of large rewards, with the other firing strongly for small rewards. Conversely, putative dopamine neurons showed positive phasic responses to reward-indicating cues and the receipt of an unexpected reward amount, which supports the reward prediction error signal hypothesis of dopamine. I suggest that the tonic reward monitoring signal of the DRN, possibly together with its interaction with the dopamine system, reports a continuous level of motivation throughout the performance of a task. Such a signal may provide ``reward context'' information to the targets of DRN projections, where it may be integrated further with incoming motivationally salient information.",

In particular, the amygdala has been shown to be an essential component of the circuitry underlying fear-related responses. Disorders in the processing of fear-related information are likely to be the underlying cause of some anxiety disorders in humans such as posttraumatic stress. The amygdaloid complex is a group of more than 10 nuclei that are located in the midtemporal lobe. These nuclei can be distinguished both on cytoarchitectonic and connectional grounds. Anatomical tract tracing studies have shown that these nuclei have extensive intranuclear and internuclear connections. The afferent and efferent connections of the amygdala have also been mapped in detail, showing that the amygdaloid complex has extensive connections with cortical and subcortical regions. Analysis of fear conditioning in rats has suggested that long-term synaptic plasticity of inputs to the amygdala underlies the acquisition and perhaps storage of the fear memory. In agreement with this proposal, synaptic plasticity has been demonstrated at synapses in the amygdala in both in vitro and in vivo studies. In this review, we examine the anatomical and physiological substrates proposed to underlie amygdala function.",

abstract="The basal forebrain is a confluence of systems that are crucial to understanding some of the most important functions of the brain, including reward and punishment, learning and cognition, and feeding and reproduction. Basic to understanding this broad spectrum of behavior is untangling the interwoven functional systems in basal forebrain. This has been grounded by the appreciation that the major nearby structures, that is, amygdala and basal ganglia, provide a context for interpreting basal forebrain areas that are best viewed as extensions of either of these larger regions. The components of basal forebrain, the ventral striatopallidal system and the medial and central divisions of extended amygdala, are subcortical relays for information garnered from brain stem, thalamus, and cortical areas. With respect to the classically defined amygdala of the temporal lobe, the lateral-basolateral complex, and the superficial amygdaloid nuclei may tentatively be viewed as specialized cortical regions. Their output targets both the striatopallidal complex and the extended amygdala, with some of the most massive basal forebrain efferents originating in the basolateral amygdaloid complex. The subcortical projections of the basolateral nucleus, at least in the rat, appear to be dichotomous, with anterior (or magnocellular) portions of the nucleus preferentially targeting striatum and ventral striatum (including the core of the nucleus accumbens), while the posterior (small-celled) portions of the basolateral nucleus target the extended amygdala as well as the shell of the nucleus accumbens. This divergence represents a particular opportunity for behavioral neuroscientists analyzing basal forebrain functions. Studies exploiting the dual subcortical projection of basolateral amygdala indicate distinct functional roles for striatum versus extended amygdala. These reinforce the identification of extended amygdala as a functional-anatomical entity distinct from the striatopallidal system.",

abstract="Interconnections between orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and basolateral amygdala (ABL) are critical for encoding and using associative information about the motivational significance of stimuli. Previously, we reported that neurons in OFC and ABL fired selectively to cues during odor discrimination learning and reversal training. Here we conducted an analysis of correlated firing in the cell pairs recorded in the previous study. Correlated firing during the intertrial intervals was compared across task phases during different phases of acquisition and reversal learning. Changes in correlated activity during initial learning and subsequent accurate performance on the discrimination problems closely resembled the changes in odor selectivity in OFC and ABL reported earlier. Increased correlated firing was most pronounced in OFC during accurate go, no-go performance in the postcriterion phase of performance, whereas correlated firing in ABL increased primarily during an earlier phase of learning. In contrast, findings during subsequent reversal training diverged from our earlier report in which odor selectivity diminished in OFC and reversed in ABL. When the reinforcement contingencies of the odors were reversed after the rat had learned the original associations, correlated firing further increased significantly in OFC but remained stable in ABL. This evidence that associative encoding increments with reversal learning in OFC suggests that the original associations, although not expressed as stimulus driven activity, may be maintained within the network as new associations are acquired.",

We therefore generated a comprehensive whole-brain atlas defining the monosynaptic inputs onto forebrain-projecting serotonergic neurons of dorsal versus median raphe based on a genetically restricted transsynaptic retrograde tracing strategy. We identified discrete inputs onto serotonergic neurons from forebrain and brainstem neurons, with specific inputs from hypothalamus, cortex, basal ganglia, and midbrain, displaying a greater than anticipated complexity and diversity in cell-type-specific connectivity. We identified and functionally confirmed monosynaptic glutamatergic inputs from prefrontal cortex and lateral habenula onto serotonergic neurons as well as a direct GABAergic input from striatal projection neurons. In summary, our findings emphasize the role of hyperdirect inputs to serotonergic neurons. Cell-type-specific classification of connectivity patterns will allow for further functional analysis of the diverse but specific inputs that control serotonergic neurons during behavior.",

abstract="We have recently demonstrated that systemic administration of 5-HT(2C) and 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonists significantly enhanced and impaired spatial reversal learning, respectively. In this study, the role of 5-HT(2C) and 5-HT(2A) receptor subtypes in the mediation of these opposing effects was further investigated with respect to neuroanatomical specificity. The roles of 5-HT(2C) and 5-HT(2A) receptors were examined within some of the brain regions implicated in cognitive flexibility, namely the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and nucleus accumbens (NAc), by means of targeted infusions of selective 5-HT(2C) and 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonists (SB 242084 and M100907, respectively). Intra-OFC 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonism produced dose-dependent effects similar to those of systemic administration, i.e., improved spatial reversal learning by reducing the number of trials (all doses: 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 microg) and perseverative errors to criterion (0.3 and 1.0 microg) compared with controls. However, the highest dose (1.0 microg) showed a nonselective effect, as it also affected retention preceding the reversal phase and decreased learning errors. Intracerebral infusions of SB 242084 into the mPFC or NAc produced no significant effects on any behavioral measures. Similarly, no significant differences were observed with intra-OFC, -mPFC, or -NAc infusions of M100907. These data suggest that the improved performance in reversal learning observed after 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonism is mediated within the OFC. These data also bear on the issue of whether 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonism within the OFC might help elucidate the biological substrate of obsessive-compulsive disorder, offering the potential for therapeutic application.",

abstract="Serotonin (5-HT) is thought to play an important role in the regulation of behavioral inhibition. Studies manipulating 5-HT function in the rodent brain indicate that 5-HT receptors regulate distinct forms of impulsive behavior, including impulsive responding in the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5CSRTT). The present study investigates the loci of effects mediated by 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptors in attention and inhibitory response control using microinfusions targeted at the nucleus accumbens (NAc), prelimbic cortex (PL) and infralimbic cortex (IL). Rats were implanted with bilateral guide cannulas and received infusions of the selective 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist M100907 (0.1 and 0.3 microg) or selective 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonist SB242084 (0.1 and 0.5 microg) immediately prior to testing. The results show that intra-NAc infusions of M100907 significantly decrease impulsive responding on the 5CSRTT and at the highest dose increased omissions as well. By contrast, infusions of SB242084 into the NAc selectively and dose-dependently increased impulsivity. Neither M100907 nor SB242084 significantly altered impulsive responding following either intra-PL or intra-IL administration. However, SB242084 significantly decreased omissions following intra-PL administration (0.5 microg only). These data reveal opposing effects on impulsivity following 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) blockade in the NAc. Our results suggest that the NAc, but not the PL or IL, is implicated in the mediation of the effects of M100907 and SB242084 on inhibitory response control during baseline 5CSRTT performance.",

abstract="Impulsivity is a multifactorial phenomenon, determined by deficits in decision-making (impulsive choice) and impulse control (impulsive action). Recent findings indicate that impulsive behaviour is not only top-down controlled by cortical areas, but also modulated at subcortical level. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) might be a key substrate in cortico-limbic-striatal circuits involved in impulsive behaviour. Dissociable effects of the NAc subregions in various behavioural paradigms point to a potential functional distinction between NAc core and shell concerning different types of impulsivity. The present study used reversible inactivation of the rats' NAc core and shell via bilateral microinfusion of the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol (0.05$\mu$g/0.3$\mu$l) and fluorophore-conjugated muscimol (FCM, 0.27$\mu$g/0.3$\mu$l) in order to study their contribution to different aspects of impulse control in a 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) and impulsive choice in a delay-based decision-making T-maze task. Acute inactivation of NAc core as well as shell by muscimol increased impulsive choice, with higher impairments of the rats' waiting capacity in the T-maze following core injections compared to shell. Intra-NAc shell infusion of muscimol also induced specific impulse control deficits in the 5-CSRTT, while deactivation of the core caused severe general impairments in task performance. FCM did not affect animal behaviour. Our findings reveal clear involvement of NAc shell in both forms of impulsivity. Both subareas play a key role in the regulation of impulsive decision-making, but show functional dichotomy regarding impulse control with the core being more implicated in motivational and motor aspects.",

abstract="In rodents, the five-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) has been established as a reliable measure of waiting impulsivity being defined as the ability to regulate a response in anticipation of reinforcement. Key brain structures are the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and prefrontal regions (for example, pre- and infralimbic cortex), which are, together with other transmitters, modulated by serotonin. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we examined 103 healthy males while performing the 5-CSRTT measuring brain activation in humans by means of a paradigm that has been widely applied in rodents. Subjects were genotyped for the tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (TPH2; G-703T; rs4570625) variant, an enzyme specific for brain serotonin synthesis. We addressed neural activation patterns of waiting impulsivity and the interaction between the NAcc and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) using dynamic causal modeling. Genetic influence was examined via interaction analyses between the TPH2 genotype (GG homozygotes vs T allele carriers) and the degree of impulsivity as measured by the 5-CSRTT. We found that the driving input of the vmPFC was reduced in highly impulsive T allele carriers (reflecting a reduced top-down control) in combination with an enhanced response in the NAcc after correct target processing (reflecting an augmented response to monetary reward). Taken together, we found a high overlap of our findings with reports from animal studies in regard to the underlying cognitive processes, the brain regions associated with waiting impulsivity and the neural interplay between the NAcc and vmPFC. Therefore, we conclude that the 5-CSRTT is a promising tool for translational studies.",

abstract="Decision making is an adaptive behavior that takes into account several internal and external input variables and leads to the choice of a course of action over other available and often competing alternatives. While it has been studied in diverse fields ranging from mathematics, economics, ecology, and ethology to psychology and neuroscience, recent cross talk among perspectives from different fields has yielded novel descriptions of decision processes. Reinforcement-guided decision making models are based on economic and reinforcement learning theories, and their focus is on the maximization of acquired benefit over a defined period of time. Studies based on reinforcement-guided decision making have implicated a large network of neural circuits across the brain. This network includes a wide range of cortical (e.g., orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex) and subcortical (e.g., nucleus accumbens and subthalamic nucleus) brain areas and uses several neurotransmitter systems (e.g., dopaminergic and serotonergic systems) to communicate and process decision-related information. This review discusses distinct as well as overlapping contributions of these networks and neurotransmitter systems to the processing of decision making. We end the review by touching on neural circuitry and neuromodulatory regulation of exploratory decision making.",

Based on the findings described in this review, the following pattern of central 5-HT electrophysiology is emerging: 1) inhibitory effects are mediated by 5-HT1 receptors linked to the opening of K channels via pertussis-toxin sensitive G proteins: 2) facilitatory effects are mediated by 5-HT2 receptors and involve the closing of K channels, an effect which appears to be negatively modulated by activation of the PI second messenger system: 3) fast excitations are mediated by 5-HT3 receptors, most likely involving a direct interaction with an ion channel rather than through coupling with a G protein or a second messenger. Further studies will be required in a wider range of brain areas to establish the generality of these conclusions.",

Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin anterograde tracing studies confirmed that the medial prefrontal cortex provides the major afferent input to each subdivision of the DR. Double-labeling studies combining WG tracing and glutamate immunostaining indicated that the medial prefrontal cortex, various hypothalamic nuclei including perifornical, lateral, and arcuate nuclei, and several medullary regions such as lateral and medial parabrachial nuclei, and laterodorsal tegmental nucleus provide the major glutamatergic input to each subregion of the DR. It should be noted that the degree of glutamatergic input from these afferent sites was specific for each DR subdivision. The present findings indicated that dorsomedial, ventromedial, lateral wing, and caudal subdivisions of the DR receive excitatory inputs from both cortical and subcortical sites which might be involved in regulation or modulation of a broad range of systems, including sensory and motor functions, arousal and sleep-wake cycle, biorhythmic, cognitive, and affective behaviors.",

abstract="Anatomical evidence indicates that medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) neurons project to the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR). In this study, we functionally characterized this descending pathway in rat brain. Projection neurons in the mPFC were identified by antidromic stimulation from the DR. Electrical stimulation of the mPFC mainly inhibited the activity of DR 5-HT neurons (55 of 66). Peristimulus time histograms showed a silence of 150 +/- 9 msec poststimulus (latency, 36 +/- 1 msec). The administration of WAY-100635 and picrotoxinin partly reversed this inhibition, indicating the involvement of 5-HT(1A) and GABA(A) receptors. In rats depleted of 5-HT with p-chlorophenylalanine, the electrical stimulation of mPFC mainly activated 5-HT neurons (31 of 40). The excitations (latency, 17 +/- 1 msec) were antagonized by MK-801 and NBQX. Likewise, MK-801 prevented the rise in DR 5-HT release induced by electrical stimulation of mPFC. The application of 8-OH-DPAT in mPFC significantly inhibited the firing rate of DR 5-HT neurons and, in dual-probe microdialysis experiments, reduced the 5-HT output in mPFC and DR. Furthermore, the application of WAY-100635 in mPFC significantly antagonized the reduction of 5-HT release produced by systemic 8-OH-DPAT administration in both areas. These results indicate the existence of a complex regulation of DR 5-HT neurons by mPFC afferents. The stimulus-induced excitation of some 5-HT neurons by descending excitatory fibers releases 5-HT, which inhibits the same or other DR neurons by acting on 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors. Afferents from the mPFC also inhibit 5-HT neurons through the activation of GABAergic interneurons. Ascending serotonergic pathways may control the activity of this descending pathway by acting on postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors.",

abstract="The prefrontal cortex (PFC) receives strong inputs from monoaminergic cell groups in the brainstem and also sends projections to these nuclei. Recent evidence suggests that the PFC exerts a powerful top-down control over the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) and that it may be involved in the actions of pharmaceutical drugs and drugs of abuse. In the light of these findings, the precise origin of prefrontal inputs to DR was presently investigated by using the cholera toxin subunit b (CTb) as retrograde tracer. All the injections placed in DR produced retrograde labeling in the medial, orbital, and lateral divisions of the PFC as well as in the medial part of the frontal polar cortex. The labeling was primarily located in layer V. Remarkably, labeling in the medial PFC was denser in its ventral part (infralimbic and ventral prelimbic cortices) than in its dorsal part (dorsal prelimbic, anterior cingulate and medial precentral cortices). After injections in the rostral or caudal DR, the largest number of labeled neurons was observed in the medial PFC, whereas after injections in the mid-rostrocaudal DR, the labeled neurons were more homogeneously distributed in the three main PFC divisions. A cluster of labeled neurons also was observed around the apex of the rostral pole of the accumbens, especially after rostral and mid-rostrocaudal DR injections. Overall, these results confirm the existence of robust prefrontal projections to DR, mainly derived from the ventral part of the medial PFC, and underscore a substantial contribution of the frontal polar cortex.",

Over the years, the DRN has emerged as a multifunctional and multitransmitter nucleus, which modulates or influences many CNS processes. It is a phylogenetically old brain area, whose projections reach out to a large number of regions and nuclei of the CNS, particularly in the forebrain. Several DRN-related discoveries are tightly connected with important events in the history of neuroscience, for example the invention of new histological methods, the discovery of new neurotransmitter systems and the link between neurotransmitter function and mood disorders. One of the main reasons for the wide current interest in the DRN is the nucleus' involvement in depression. This involvement is particularly attributable to the main transmitter of the DRN, serotonin. Starting with a historical perspective, this essay describes the morphology, ascending projections and multitransmitter nature of the DRN, and stresses its role as a key target for depression research.",

abstract="The lateral habenula (LHb) is an epithalamic structure differentiated in a medial (LHbM) and a lateral division (LHbL). Together with the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), the LHb has been implicated in the processing of aversive stimuli and inhibitory control of monoamine nuclei. The inhibitory LHb influence on midbrain dopamine neurons has been shown to be mainly mediated by the RMTg, a mostly GABAergic nucleus that receives a dominant input from the LHbL. Interestingly, the RMTg also projects to the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR), which also receives direct LHb projections. To compare the organization and transmitter phenotype of LHb projections to the DR, direct and indirect via the RMTg, we first placed injections of the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin into the LHb or the RMTg. We then confirmed our findings by retrograde tracing and investigated a possible GABAergic phenotype of DR-projecting RMTg neurons by combining retrograde tracing with in situ hybridization for GAD67. We found only moderate direct LHb projections to the DR, which mainly emerged from the LHbM and were predominantly directed to the serotonin-rich caudal DR. In contrast, RMTg projections to the DR were more robust, emerged from RMTg neurons enriched in GAD67 mRNA, and were focally directed to a distinctive DR subdivision immunohistochemically characterized as poor in serotonin and enriched in presumptive glutamatergic neurons. Thus, besides its well-acknowledged role as a GABAergic control center for the ventral tegmental area (VTA)-nigra complex, our findings indicate that the RMTg is also a major GABAergic relay between the LHb and the DR.",

abstract="The lateral habenula (LHb) has recently been identified as a key regulator of the reward system by driving inhibition onto dopaminergic neurons. However, the nature and potential modulation of the major input to the LHb originating from the basal ganglia are poorly understood. Although the output of the basal ganglia is thought to be primarily inhibitory, here we show that transmission from the basal ganglia to the LHb is excitatory, glutamatergic, and suppressed by serotonin. Behaviorally, activation of this pathway is aversive, consistent with its role as an ``antireward'' signal. Our demonstration of an excitatory projection from the basal ganglia to the LHb explains how LHb-projecting basal ganglia neurons can have similar encoding properties as LHb neurons themselves. Our results also provide a link between antireward excitatory synapses and serotonin,?a neuromodulator implicated in depression.",

abstract="The lateral habenula (LHb) is part of the habenula complex of the dorsal thalamus. Recent studies of the LHb have focused on its projections to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), which contain $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons that mediate reward prediction error via inhibition of dopaminergic activity. However, older studies in the rat have also identified LHb outputs to the lateral and posterior hypothalamus, median raphe, dorsal raphe, and dorsal tegmentum. Although these studies have shown that the medial and lateral divisions of the LHb have somewhat distinct projections, the topographic specificity of LHb efferents is not completely understood, and the relative extent of these projections to brainstem targets is unknown. Here we have used anterograde tracing with adeno-associated virus-mediated expression of green fluorescent protein, combined with serial two-photon tomography, to map the efferents of the LHb on a standard coordinate system for the entire mouse brain, and reconstruct the efferent pathways of the LHb in three dimensions. Using automated quantitation of fiber density, we show that in addition to the RMTg, the median raphe, caudal dorsal raphe, and pontine central gray are major recipients of LHb efferents. By using retrograde tract tracing with cholera toxin subunit B, we show that LHb neurons projecting to the hypothalamus, VTA, median raphe, caudal dorsal raphe, and pontine central gray reside in characteristic, but sometimes overlapping regions of the LHb. Together these results provide the anatomical basis for systematic studies of LHb function in neural circuits and behavior in mice. J. Comp.

abstract="The basal ganglia (BG) integrate inputs from diverse sensorimotor, limbic, and associative regions to guide action-selection and goal-directed behaviors. The entopeduncular nucleus (EP) is a major BG output nucleus and has been suggested to channel signals from distinct BG nuclei to target regions involved in diverse functions. Here we use single-cell transcriptional and molecular analyses to demonstrate that the EP contains at least three classes of projection neurons-glutamate/GABA co-releasing somatostatin neurons, glutamatergic parvalbumin neurons, and GABAergic parvalbumin neurons. These classes comprise functionally and anatomically distinct output pathways that differentially affect EP target regions, such as the lateral habenula (LHb) and thalamus. Furthermore, LHb- and thalamic-projecting EP neurons are differentially innervated by subclasses of striatal and pallidal neurons. Therefore, we identify previously unknown subdivisions within the EP and reveal the existence of cascading, molecularly distinct projections through striatum and globus pallidus to EP targets within epithalamus and thalamus.",

abstract="Effective decision-making requires organisms to predict reward values and bias behavior toward the best available option. The mesolimbic dopamine system, including the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell and core, is involved in this process. Although studies support a role of the shell and core in specific aspects of decision-making (e.g., risk, effort, delay), no studies have directly compared dopamine release dynamics in these subregions to cues exclusively signaling the availability of different reward magnitudes. Here, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry was used to compare rapid dopamine release dynamics in the NAc subregions during a magnitude-based decision-making task. Rats learned that distinct cues signaled the availability of either a small or large reward (one or two sugar pellets), and then were given an opportunity to choose their preferred option. We found that peak dopamine release tracked the more preferred (higher-magnitude) option in both core and shell subregions. Critically, however, overall (i.e., global) dopamine release was significantly higher and longer lasting in the shell and tracked the preferred magnitude during the entire cue period. Further, in the shell (not core), dopamine signaling significantly declined immediately at the lever press for reward but increased during the period of reward consumption. Collectively, the results indicate that although dopamine release in both the core and shell are activated by cues signaling the opportunity to respond for rewards of different magnitudes, dopamine release in the shell plays a differential and unique role in tracking information related to the outcome value of reward.",

abstract="Mesolimbic dopamine (DA) is phasically released during appetitive behaviors, though there is substantive disagreement about the specific purpose of these DA signals. For example, prediction error (PE) models suggest a role of learning, while incentive salience (IS) models argue that the DA signal imbues stimuli with value and thereby stimulates motivated behavior. However, within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) patterns of DA release can strikingly differ between subregions, and as such, it is possible that these patterns differentially contribute to aspects of PE and IS. To assess this, we measured DA release in subregions of the NAc during a behavioral task that spatiotemporally separated sequential goal-directed stimuli. Electrochemical methods were used to measure subsecond NAc dopamine release in the core and shell during a well learned instrumental chain schedule in which rats were trained to press one lever (seeking; SL) to gain access to a second lever (taking; TL) linked with food delivery, and again during extinction. In the core, phasic DA release was greatest following initial SL presentation, but minimal for the subsequent TL and reward events. In contrast, phasic shell DA showed robust release at all task events. Signaling decreased between the beginning and end of sessions in the shell, but not core. During extinction, peak DA release in the core showed a graded decrease for the SL and pauses in release during omitted expected rewards, whereas shell DA release decreased predominantly during the TL. These release dynamics suggest parallel DA signals capable of supporting distinct theories of appetitive behavior.",

The NAc is necessary for using information about expected outcome values to guide behavior after reinforcer devaluation. Evidence suggests that core and shell subregions may play dissociable roles in guiding motivated behavior. Here, we recorded neural activity in the NAc core and shell during training and performance of a reinforcer devaluation task. Long-Evans male rats were trained that presses on a lever under an illuminated cue light delivered a flavored sucrose reward. On subsequent test days, each rat was given free access to one of two distinctly flavored foods to consume to satiation and were then immediately tested on the lever pressing task under extinction conditions. Rats decreased pressing on the test day when the reinforcer earned during training was the sated flavor (devalued) compared with the test day when the reinforcer was not the sated flavor (nondevalued), demonstrating evidence of outcome-selective devaluation. Cue-selective encoding during training by NAc core (but not shell) neurons reliably predicted subsequent behavioral performance; that is, the greater the percentage of neurons that responded to the cue, the better the rats suppressed responding after devaluation. In contrast, NAc shell (but not core) neurons significantly decreased cue-selective encoding in the devalued condition compared with the nondevalued condition. These data reveal that NAc core and shell neurons encode information differentially about outcome-specific cues after reinforcer devaluation that are related to behavioral performance and outcome value, respectively.",

abstract="Many of the neurocircuits and hormones known to underlie the sensations of hunger and satiety also substantially alter the activity of the dopaminergic reward system. Much interest lies in the ways that hunger, satiety, and reward tie together, as the epidemic of obesity seems tied to the recent development and mass availability of highly palatable foods. In this review, we will first discuss the basic neurocircuitry of the midbrain and basal forebrain reward system. We will elaborate how several important mediators of hunger-the agouti-related protein neurons of the arcuate nucleus, the lateral hypothalamic nucleus, and ghrelin-enhance the sensitivity of the dopaminergic reward system. Then, we will elaborate how mediators of satiety-the nucleus tractus solitarius, pro-opiomelanocortin neurons of the arcuate nucleus, and its peripheral hormonal influences such as leptin-reduce the reward system sensitivity. We hope to provide a template by which future research may identify the ways in which highly rewarding foods bypass this balanced system to produce excessive food consumption.",

abstract="Homeostasis describes the fundamental biological ability of individuals to maintain stable internal conditions in a changing environment. Homeostatic reactions include internal adjustments as well as behavioral responses. In vertebrates, behavioral responses are induced by the reward system. This system originates in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and leads to increased dopamine levels in the forebrain whenever activated. A major inhibitor of VTA activity is the lateral habenula (LHb). This epithalamic structure is able to almost completely suppress dopamine release, either directly or via the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), when rewarding expectations are not met. A major input to the LHb arises from the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), an important regulator of the homeostatic system. Currently, little is known about the effects of the strong hypothalamic projection on the activity of LHb neurons. In the present study, we analyze neurotransmitters and cellular targets of the LHA-LHb projection in the rat. Therefore, anterograde tracing from the LHA was combined with the visualization of neurotransmitters in the LHb. These experiments revealed a mainly glutamatergic projection, probably exerting excitatory effects on the targeted LHb cells. These cellular targets were analyzed in a second step. Anterograde tracing from the LHA in combination with retrograde tracing from the VTA/RMTg region revealed that LHb neurons projecting to the VTA/RMTg region are densely targeted by the LHA projection. Visualization of synaptophysin at these contact sites indicates that the contact sites indeed are synapses. Taken together, the present study describes a strong mainly glutamatergic projection from the LHA that targets VTA/RMTg-projecting neurons in the LHb. These findings emphasize the potential role of the LHb as direct link between homeostatic areas and reward circuitries, which may be important for the control of homeostatic behaviors.",

However, there was little direct evidence demonstrating that neurotransmitters in the LH could, like electrical stimulation, elicit feeding in satiated animals. The present paper is a brief review in honor of Bartley Hoebel's scientific contributions, emphasizing the evidence from my lab that the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the LH mediate feeding stimulation and feeding inhibition respectively. Specifically, we summarize evidence that LH injection of glutamate, or agonists of its N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA receptors, elicits feeding in satiated rats, that NMDA receptor antagonists block the eating elicited by NMDA and, more importantly, that NMDA blockade suppresses natural feeding and can reduce body weight. Conversely, GABA(A) agonists injected into the LH suppress feeding and can also reduce body weight, while GABA(A) receptor antagonists actually elicit eating when injected into the LH of satiated rats. It is suggested that natural feeding may reflect the moment-to-moment balance in the activity of glutamate and GABA within the LH.",

Recent findings show that motivational signals arising from the VTA can also be carried by non-dopamine-releasing projection neurons, which have their own specific connectivity. Both dopamine-releasing and non-dopamine-releasing VTA neurons integrate afferent signals with local inhibitory or excitatory inputs to generate particular output firing patterns.

We used optogenetic tools to selectively stimulate VTA dopaminergic neuron action potential firing in freely behaving mammals.

While it is emphasized that the accumbens exhibits multiple levels of complex organization, a fairly complete list of brief descriptions of recent studies devoted specifically to the accumbens shell and core subterritories is presented in tabular format. The distinct patterns of connectivity of the accumbens core and shell and structures related to them by connections are described. Multiple inputs, outputs and abundant reciprocity of connections within the ventral parts of the basal ganglia are emphasized and the implications for "through-put" of impulses is considered. It is noted, at least on neuroanatomical grounds, that there is ample reason to expect feed forward processing from shell and structures with which it is associated to core and structures with which it is associated. Furthermore, the potential for additional feed forward processing involving several forebrain functional anatomical systems, inlcuding the ventral striatopallidum, extended amygdala and magnocellular basal forebrain complex is considered. It is intended that from the considerations recorded here a conceptual framework will begin to emerge that is amenable to further experimental substantiation as regards how multiple basal forebrain systems and the cortices to which they are related by connections work together to fashion a unitary object--the adaptive response.}",

abstract = "{In a restrictive food environment, the homeostatic control system regulates body weight and adiposity with remarkable precision. However, this regulation appears to break down in many genetically predisposed individuals under conditions prevailing in the modern era characterized by a sedentary lifestyle and easy availability of large portions of palatable and calorically dense food. The nervous system is the main interface by which food-related environmental factors influence the regulatory process. Thus, focusing on the neural systems located in the telencephalon dealing with environmental factors, and on their connections with the homeostatic regulatory system distributed mainly in the hypothalamus and brainstem, should result in new drug targets and behavioral strategies for prevention and therapy. The structures providing this interface with the environment are involved in the initiation, procurement, and appetitive phases of ingestive behavior and associative learning before, during, and after the consummatory phase. It is thought that learned and unlearned representations of foods and food cues in the orbitofrontal and other cortical areas are filtered for affective/emotional value in the amygdala and for motivational salience in the nucleus accumbens/ventral striatum to initiate goal-directed motor programs. Internal state signals generated by the metabolic sensing mechanisms in the hypothalamus interact with each of these corticolimbic structures through reciprocal connections. While many projections from the hypothalamus contain the various "feeding peptides," the neurochemistry of projections to the hypothalamus has not been well characterized.}",

The NAc and VP play special roles in mediating the hedonic impact (``liking'') and motivational incentive salience (``wanting'') of food rewards, and their interactions with LH help permit regulatory hunger/satiety modulation of food motivation and reward. Here, we review some progress that has been made regarding this circuitry and its functions: the identification of localized anatomical hedonic hotspots within NAc and VP for enhancing hedonic impact; interactions of NAc/VP hedonic hotspots with specific LH signals such as orexin; an anterior-posterior gradient of sites in NAc shell for producing intense appetitive eating vs. intense fearful reactions; and anatomically distributed appetitive functions of dopamine and mu opioid signals in NAc shell and related structures. Such findings help improve our understanding of NAc, VP, and LH interactions in mediating affective and motivation functions, including ``liking'' and ``wanting'' for food rewards.",

The nucleus accumbens may play an important role in behavioral flexibility, representing learned stimulus-reward associations in neural activity during response selection and learning from results. To investigate the role of nucleus accumbens neural activity in behavioral flexibility, we used light-activated halorhodopsin to inhibit nucleus accumbens shell neurons during specific time segments of a bar-pressing task requiring a win-stay/lose-shift strategy. We found that optogenetic inhibition during action selection in the time segment preceding a lever press had no effect on performance. However, inhibition occurring in the time segment during feedback of results--whether rewards or nonrewards--reduced the errors that occurred after a change in contingency. Our results demonstrate critical time segments during which nucleus accumbens shell neurons integrate feedback into subsequent responses. Inhibiting nucleus accumbens shell neurons in these time segments, during reinforced performance or after a change in contingencies, increases lose-shift behavior. We propose that the activity of nucleus shell accumbens shell neurons in these time segments plays a key role in integrating knowledge of results into subsequent behavior, as well as in modulating lose-shift behavior when contingencies change.",

abstract="Different subregions of nucleus accumbens (NAc) have been implicated in reward seeking, promoting flexible approach responses, suppressing nonrewarded actions, and facilitating shifts between different discrimination strategies. Interestingly, the NAc does not appear to mediate shifting between stimulus-reward associations (i.e., reversal learning) when reinforcement is predictable. How these nuclei may facilitate flexible response strategies when reward delivery is uncertain remains unclear. We investigated the effects of inactivation of the NAc shell and core on probabilistic reversal learning using an operant task wherein a ``correct'' response delivered reward on 80\% of trials, and an ``incorrect'' response was reinforced on 20\% of trials. Reinforcement contingencies were reversed repeatedly within a session. In well-trained rats, shell inactivation reduced the number of reversals completed and selectively reduced win-stay behavior. This impairment was apparent during the first discrimination, indicating a more general deficit in the use of probabilistic reward feedback to guide action selection. Shell inactivation also impaired reversal performance on a similar task where correct/incorrect choices always/never delivered reward. However, this impairment only emerged after both levers had been associated with reward. Inactivation of NAc core did not impair reversal performance but increased latencies to approach the response levers. These results suggest the NAc shell and core facilitate reward seeking in a distinct yet complementary manner when the relationship between specific actions and reward is uncertain or ambiguous and cognitive flexibility is required. The core promotes approach toward reward-associated stimuli, whereas the shell refines response selection to those specific actions more likely to yield reward.",

abstract="Activation of serotonin 5-HT4 receptors has pro-cognitive effects on memory performance. The proposed underlying neurochemical mechanism is the enhancement of acetylcholine release in frontal cortex and hippocampus elicited by 5-HT4 agonists. Although 5-HT4 receptors are present in brain areas related to cognition, e.g., hippocampus and cortex, the cellular localization of the receptors that might modulate acetylcholine release is unknown at present. We have analyzed, using dual label in situ hybridization, the cellular localization of 5-HT4 receptor mRNA in identified neuronal populations of the rat basal forebrain, which is the source of the cholinergic innervation to cortex and hippocampus. 5-HT4 receptor mRNA was visualized with isotopically labeled oligonucleotide probes, whereas cholinergic, glutamatergic, GABAergic and parvalbumin-synthesizing neurons were identified with digoxigenin-labeled oligonucleotide probes. 5-HT4 receptor mRNA was not detected in the basal forebrain cholinergic cell population. In contrast, basal forebrain GABAergic, parvalbumin synthesizing, and glutamatergic cells contained 5-HT4 receptor mRNA. Hippocampal and cortical glutamatergic neurons also express this receptor. These results indicate that 5-HT4 receptors are not synthesized by cholinergic cells, and thus would be absent from cholinergic terminals. In contrast, several non-cholinergic cell populations within the basal forebrain and its target hippocampal and cortical areas express these receptors and are thus likely to mediate the enhancement of acetylcholine release elicited by 5-HT4 agonists.

ESP(5-HT4) displayed characteristics different from EPSP-spike potentiation that accompanies long-term potentiation; it developed without an associated increase in synaptic transmission, was independent on afferent input, activity of postsynaptic neurons and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activation; and was expressed in the presence of GABA receptor antagonists. ESP(5-HT4) was also induced by transient application of the natural neurotransmitter, 5-HT. The increase in the evoked population spike (PS) induced by SDZ-216454 was not prevented by blockers of hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih), Cs+ and ZD-7288, but was mimicked and occluded by 150 microm Ba2+. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from pyramidal neurons demonstrated that SDZ-216454 application increases membrane resistance with a concomitant decrease in a Ba2+-sensitive inwardly rectifying K+ current and the Ba2+-insensitive K+ current underlying slow afterhyperpolarization (I(sAHP)).

abstract="The role of dopamine in decision making has received much attention from both the experimental and computational communities. However, because reinforcement learning models concentrate on discrete action selection and on phasic dopamine signals, they are silent as to how animals decide upon the rate of their actions, and they fail to account for the prominent effects of dopamine on response rates. We suggest an extension to reinforcement learning models in which response rates are optimally determined by balancing the tradeoff between the cost of fast responding and the benefit of rapid reward acquisition. The resulting behavior conforms well with numerous characteristics of free-operant responding. More importantly, this framework highlights a role for a tonic signal corresponding to the net rate of rewards, in determining the optimal rate of responding. We hypothesize that this critical quantity is conveyed by tonic levels of dopamine, explaining why dopaminergic manipulations exert a global affect on response rates. We further suggest that the effects of motivation on instrumental rates of responding are mediated through its influence on the net reward rate, implying a tight coupling between motivational states and tonic dopamine. The relationships between phasic and tonic dopamine signaling, and between directing and energizing effects of motivation, as well as the implications for motivational control of habitual and goal-directed instrumental action selection, are discussed.",

abstract="The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) receives a dense serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT) innervation from the dorsal raphe nucleus, with a smaller contribution from the median raphe nucleus. The reciprocal innervation from the OFC enables the OFC to regulate not only its own 5-HT input but the 5-HT input to the rest of the forebrain. This article reviews the evidence from studies in rodents and primates that implicate 5-HT in the OFC in the ability of animals to adapt their responding to changes in reward contingencies in the environment. A consensus is emerging that reductions in orbitofrontal 5-HT, whether the result of localized infusions of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT), peripheral treatment with parachloroamphetamine (PCA) or para-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA), or chronic cold stress impairs this ability. Genetic variation in the 5-HT transporter can also affect this ability. An explanation regarding insensitivity to reward loss is ruled out by the finding that marmosets with 5-HT reductions in the OFC display a decline of responding as rapid as that of control animals when reward is withheld during extinction of a two-pattern discrimination task. The failure of these same animals to explore alternative stimuli during extinction, along with the recent electrophysiological evidence that dorsal raphe nucleus neurons encode future motivational outcomes, implicates orbitofrontal 5-HT in the process by which animals either exploit current resources or explore alternative resources based on current reward expectations.",

abstract="Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) contributes in multifarious ways to the regulation of brain function, spanning key aspects such as the sleep-wake cycle, appetite, mood and mental health. The 5-HT receptors comprise seven receptor families (5-HT) that are further subdivided into 14 receptor subtypes. The role of the 5-HT receptor in the modulation of neuronal excitability has been well documented. Recently, however, it has become apparent that the 5-HT receptor may contribute significantly to cognition and regulates less ostensible aspects of brain function: it engages in metaplastic regulation of synaptic responsiveness in key brain structures such as the hippocampus, thereby specifically promoting persistent forms of synaptic plasticity, and influences the direction of change in synaptic strength in selected hippocampal subfields. This highly specific neuromodulatory control by the 5-HT receptor may in turn explain the reported role for this receptor in hippocampus-dependent cognition. In this review article, we describe the role of the 5-HT receptor in hippocampal function, and describe how this receptor plays a unique and highly specialised role in synaptic information storage and cognition.",

abstract="The 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors of serotonin play important roles as auto- and heteroreceptors controlling the release of serotonin itself and of other neurotransmitters/modulators in the central nervous system (CNS). To determine the precise localization of these receptors, we examined their respective cellular and subcellular distributions in the nucleus raphe dorsalis and hippocampal formation (5-HT1A) and in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra (5-HT1B), using light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry with specific antibodies. Both immunogold and immunoperoxidase preembedding labelings were achieved. In the nucleus raphe dorsalis, 5-HT1A immunoreactivity was found exclusively on neuronal cell bodies and dendrites, and mostly along extrasynaptic portions of their plasma membrane. After immunogold labeling, the density of membrane-associated 5-HT1A receptors could be estimated to be at least 30-40 times that in the cytoplasm. In the hippocampal formation, the somata as well as dendrites of pyramidal and granule cells displayed 5-HT1A immunoreactivity, which was also prominent on the dendritic spines of pyramidal cells. In both substantia nigra and globus pallidus, 5-HT1B receptors were preferentially associated with the membrane of fine, unmyelinated, preterminal axons, and were not found on axon terminals. A selective localization to the cytoplasm of endothelial cells of microvessels was also observed. Because the 5-HT1A receptors are somatodendritic, they are ideally situated to mediate serotonin effects on neuronal firing, both as auto- and as heteroreceptors. The localization of 5-HT1B receptors to the membrane of preterminal axons suggests that they control transmitter release from nonserotonin as well as serotonin neurons by mediating serotonin effects on axonal conduction. The fact that these two receptor subtypes predominate at extrasynaptic and nonsynaptic sites provides further evidence for diffuse serotonin transmission in the CNS.",

We have examined serotonergic modulation of rat and mouse corticostriatal neurotransmission and find that serotonin (5-HT) activates 5-HT(1b) receptors resulting in a long-term depression (LTD) of glutamate release and striatal output that we have termed 5-HT-LTD. 5-HT-LTD is presynaptically mediated, cAMP pathway dependent, and inducible by endogenous striatal 5-HT, as revealed by application of a selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor. 5-HT-LTD is mutually occlusive with dopamine/endocannabinoid-dependent LTD, suggesting that these two forms of LTD act on the same corticostriatal terminals. Thus, serotonergic and dopaminergic mechanisms exist that may interact to persistently sculpt corticostriatal circuits, potentially influencing action learning and striatal-based disorders.",

While these algorithms have been extremely powerful in interpreting dopamine activity, these models do not register any?error unless there is a difference between the value of what is predicted and what is received. Yet learning often occurs in response to changes in the unique features that characterize what is received, sometimes with no change in its value at all. Here, we show that classic error-signaling dopamine neurons also respond to changes in value-neutral sensory features of an expected reward. This suggests that dopamine neurons have access to a wider variety of information than contemplated by the models currently used to interpret their activity and that, while their firing may conform to predictions of these models in some cases, they are not restricted to signaling errors in the prediction of value.",

Recent studies on intracranial self-administration of neurochemicals (drugs) found that rats learn to self-administer various drugs into the mesolimbic dopamine structures-the posterior ventral tegmental area, medial shell nucleus accumbens and medial olfactory tubercle. In addition, studies found roles of non-dopaminergic mechanisms of the supramammillary, rostromedial tegmental and midbrain raphe nuclei in reward. To explain intracranial self-administration and related effects of various drug manipulations, I outlined a neurobiological theory claiming that there is an intrinsic central process that coordinates various selective functions (including perceptual, visceral, and reinforcement processes) into a global function of approach. Further, this coordinating process for approach arises from interactions between brain structures including those structures mentioned above and their closely linked regions: the medial prefrontal cortex, septal area, ventral pallidum, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, preoptic area, lateral hypothalamic areas, lateral habenula, periaqueductal gray, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus and parabrachical area.",

This phasic signal is proposed to support learning about antecedent cues by signaling discrepancies between actual and expected outcomes, termed a reward prediction error. However, it is unknown whether dopamine neuron prediction error signaling and cue-reward learning are causally linked. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated dopamine neuron activity in rats in two behavioral procedures, associative blocking and extinction, that illustrate the essential function of prediction errors in learning. We observed that optogenetic activation of dopamine neurons concurrent with reward delivery, mimicking a prediction error, was sufficient to cause long-lasting increases in cue-elicited reward-seeking behavior. Our findings establish a causal role for temporally precise dopamine neuron signaling in cue-reward learning, bridging a critical gap between experimental evidence and influential theoretical frameworks.",

Further AVT efferents descend to the medial half of the midbrain tegmentum including an anterior region of the median raphe nucleus, to the ventral half of the central grey substance including the dorsal raphe nucleus, to the parabrachial nuclei, and to the locus coeruleus. Similar injections centered in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra (SNC) label fibers that are distributed in the striatum in an orderly medial-to-lateral arrangement, and almost entirely avoid the nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle. With the exception of the lateral quarter of the substantia nigra, which apparently does not project to the extreme rostral pole of the striatum, each small SNC locus, regardless of its anteroposterior localization, distributes nigrostriatal fibers throughout the length of the striatum. Descending SNC efferents are distributed to the same general regions that receive descending AVT projections, except that no SNC fibers appear to enter the locus coeruleus. Isotope injections confined to the pars reticulata (SNR) label sparse nigrostriatal fibers, and numerous nigrothalamic fibers ascending mainly to the nucleus ventromedialis and in lesser number to the parafascicular nucleus and the paralamellar zone of the nucleus mediodorsalis. Descending SNR fibers leave the nigra as a voluminous fiber bundle that bifurcates into a large nigrotectal and a smaller nigrotegmental component, the latter terminating largely in the pedunculopontine nucleus of the pontomesencephalic tegmentum.",

To determine how dopamine neurons calculate prediction error, we combined optogenetic manipulations with extracellular recordings in the ventral tegmental area while mice engaged in classical conditioning. Here we demonstrate, by manipulating the temporal expectation of reward, that dopamine neurons perform subtraction, a computation that is ideal for reinforcement learning but rarely observed in the brain. Furthermore, selectively exciting and inhibiting neighbouring GABA ($\gamma$-aminobutyric acid) neurons in the ventral tegmental area reveals that these neurons are a source of subtraction: they inhibit dopamine neurons when reward is expected, causally contributing to prediction-error calculations. Finally, bilaterally stimulating ventral tegmental area GABA neurons dramatically reduces anticipatory licking to conditioned odours, consistent with an important role for these neurons in reinforcement learning. Together, our results uncover the arithmetic and local circuitry underlying dopamine prediction errors.",

abstract="Behavioral conditioning of cue-reward pairing results in a shift of midbrain dopamine (DA) cell activity from responding to the reward to responding to the predictive cue. However, the precise time course and mechanism underlying this shift remain unclear. Here, we report a combined single-unit recording and temporal difference (TD) modeling approach to this question. The data from recordings in conscious rats showed that DA cells retain responses to predicted reward after responses to conditioned cues have developed, at least early in training. This contrasts with previous TD models that predict a gradual stepwise shift in latency with responses to rewards lost before responses develop to the conditioned cue. By exploring the TD parameter space, we demonstrate that the persistent reward responses of DA cells during conditioning are only accurately replicated by a TD model with long-lasting eligibility traces (nonzero values for the parameter lambda) and low learning rate (alpha). These physiological constraints for TD parameters suggest that eligibility traces and low per-trial rates of plastic modification may be essential features of neural circuits for reward learning in the brain. Such properties enable rapid but stable initiation of learning when the number of stimulus-reward pairings is limited, conferring significant adaptive advantages in real-world environments.",

Thus, the firing rate of midbrain dopamine neurons is quantitatively predicted by theoretical descriptions of the reward prediction error signal used in reinforcement learning models for circumstances in which this signal has a positive value.

We 'tagged' serotonergic neurons with the light-sensitive protein channelrhodopsin-2 and identified them based on their responses to light. We found three main features of serotonergic neuron activity: (1) a large fraction of serotonergic neurons modulated their tonic firing rates over the course of minutes during reward vs punishment blocks; (2) most were phasically excited by punishments; and (3) a subset was phasically excited by reward-predicting cues.

abstract="Previous attempts to identify a unified theory of brain serotonin function have largely failed to achieve consensus. In this present synthesis, we integrate previous perspectives with new and older data to create a novel bipartite model centred on the view that serotonin neurotransmission enhances two distinct adaptive responses to adversity, mediated in large part by its two most prevalent and researched brain receptors: the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors. We propose that passive coping (i.e. tolerating a source of stress) is mediated by postsynaptic 5-HT1AR signalling and characterised by stress moderation. Conversely, we argue that active coping (i.e. actively addressing a source of stress) is mediated by 5-HT2AR signalling and characterised by enhanced plasticity (defined as capacity for change). We propose that 5-HT1AR-mediated stress moderation may be the brain's default response to adversity but that an improved ability to change one's situation and/or relationship to it via 5-HT2AR-mediated plasticity may also be important - and increasingly so as the level of adversity reaches a critical point. We propose that the 5-HT1AR pathway is enhanced by conventional 5-HT reuptake blocking antidepressants such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), whereas the 5-HT2AR pathway is enhanced by 5-HT2AR-agonist psychedelics. This bipartite model purports to explain how different drugs (SSRIs and psychedelics) that modulate the serotonergic system in different ways, can achieve complementary adaptive and potentially therapeutic outcomes.",

abstract="In the early 1980's, the dispute on the existence of a multiplicity of receptors for neurotransmitter was at its height. Several subtypes of serotonin (5-HT) receptors were proposed on the basis of radioligand binding assays. In order to provide further support to the existence of these receptors we performed quantitative autoradiographic mapping of the binding of several ligands for the 5-HT1 receptor labeling the subtypes 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT1C, and characterized pharmacologically these different receptors. The results demonstrated differential localization of the subtypes of 5-HT1 receptors indicating that they were expressed by different cell populations, probably neurons, in the brain and further supporting their reality. Shortly afterwards, the cloning of the genes coding for these 5-HT receptors, and many others, ended the dispute by demonstrating that they were different proteins. The advent of Molecular Biology provided new methodologies for the study of the chemical and molecular anatomy of 5-HT receptors in brain, by visualizing cells expressing their mRNA by in situ hybridization and showed that the family of mammalian 5-HT receptors has 14 members, a figure much larger than ever suspected at that time.",

abstract="The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is deeply involved in higher brain functions, many of which are altered in psychiatric conditions. The PFC exerts a top-down control of most cortical and subcortical areas through descending pathways and is densely innervated by axons emerging from the brainstem monoamine cell groups, namely, the dorsal and median raphe nuclei (DR and MnR, respectively), the ventral tegmental area and the(LC). In turn, the activity of these cell groups is tightly controlled by afferent pathways arising from layer V PFC pyramidal neurons. The reciprocal connectivity between PFC and monoamine cell groups is of interest to study the pathophysiology and treatment of severe psychiatric disorders, such as major depression and schizophrenia, inasmuch as antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs target monoamine receptors/transporters expressed in these areas. Here we review previous reports examining the presence of monoamine receptors in pyramidal and GABAergic neurons of the PFC using doublehybridization. Additionally, we present new data on the quantitative layer distribution (layers I, II-III, V, and VI) of monoamine receptor-expressing cells in the cingulate (Cg), prelimbic (PrL) and infralimbic (IL) subfields of the medial PFC (mPFC). The receptors examined include serotonin 5-HT, 5-HT, 5-HT, and 5-HT, dopamine Dand Dreceptors, and $\alpha$-, $\alpha$-, and $\alpha$-adrenoceptors. With the exception of 5-HTreceptors, selectively expressed by layers I-III GABA interneurons, the rest of monoamine receptors are widely expressed by pyramidal and GABAergic neurons in intermediate and deep layers of mPFC (5-HTreceptors are also expressed in layer I). This complex distribution suggests that monoamines may modulate the communications between PFC and cortical/subcortical areas through the activation of receptors expressed by neurons in intermediate (e.g., 5-HT, 5-HT, $\alpha$-adrenoceptors, dopamine Dreceptors) and deep layers (e.g., 5-HT, 5-HT, $\alpha$-adrenoceptors, dopamine Dreceptors), respectively. Overall, these data provide a detailed framework to better understand the role of monoamines in the processing of cognitive and emotional signals by the PFC. Likewise, they may be helpful to characterize brain circuits relevant for the therapeutic action of antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs and to improve their therapeutic action, overcoming the limitations of current drugs.",

abstract="As is well recognized, serotonergic (5-HT) fibers distribute widely throughout the brain, including the cerebral cortex. Although some early reports described the 5-HT innervation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in rats, the focus was on sensorimotor regions and not on the 'limbic' PFC - or on the medial, orbital and insular cortices. In addition, no reports have described the distribution of 5-HT fibers to PFC in rats using antisera to the serotonin transporter (SERT). Using immunostaining for SERT, we examined the pattern of distribution of 5-HT fibers to the medial, orbital and insular cortices in the rat. We show that 5-HT fibers distribute massively throughout all divisions of the PFC, with distinct laminar variations. Specifically, 5-HT fibers were densely concentrated in superficial (layer 1) and deep (layers 5/6) of the PFC but less heavily so in intermediate layers (layers 2/3). This pattern was most pronounced in the orbital cortex, particularly in the ventral and ventrolateral orbital cortices. With the emergence of granular divisions of the insular cortex, the granular cell layer (layer 4) was readily identifiable by a dense band of labeling confined to it, separating layer 4 from less heavily labeled superficial and deep layers. The pattern of 5-HT innervation of medial, orbital and insular cortices significantly differed from that of sensorimotor regions of the PFC. Serotonergic labeling was much denser overall in limbic compared to non-limbic regions of the PFC, as was striking demonstrated by the generally weaker labeling in layers 1-3 of the primary sensory and motor cortices. The massive serotonergic innervation of the medial, orbital and insular divisions of the PFC likely contributes substantially to well established serotonergic effects on affective and cognitive functions, including a key role in many neurological and psychiatric diseases.",

abstract="A series of ten experiments examined the effects of profound central 5-HT depletion on attentional performance in the rat in the five-choice serial reaction time task, and also determined the effects of such depletion on responding affected by d-amphetamine and by selective dopamine receptor antagonists. Rats were trained to detect and locate brief visual stimuli randomly presented in one of five spatial locations. When performance had stabilised (> 80\% correct, < 20\% omissions), selective central 5-HT depletion was induced by intracerebroventricular administration of the neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) following pretreatment with both a noradrenergic and a dopaminergic re-uptake inhibitor. The lesioned animals performed the five-choice serial reaction time task with the same degree of accuracy as the sham-operated controls. However, 5-HT depletion reduced the percentage of omitted trials and increased the number of premature/anticipatory responses. This pattern of behaviour following 5-HT depletion could not be attributed to enhanced primary motivation as demonstrated by measures of food intake and latencies to collect food reinforcement. The lesion attenuated the increase of premature responding induced by high doses of systemically administered d-amphetamine. 5-HT depletion also attenuated the dose-dependent decrease in accuracy induced by (-)-sulpiride, a D2 receptor antagonist, although the effects of this drug on response latencies and premature responding were similar in both groups. However, the systemic administration of the D1 receptor antagonist, SCH 23390, blocked the impulsive responding produced by the lesion as indicated by a lack of lesion effects on the percentage of omitted trials and premature responding. The results suggest that central 5-HT depletion results in impulsive, fast responding, which nevertheless does not impair accuracy of visual discrimination performance. The increased impulsivity may be mediated by altered 5-HT-dopamine interactions, with the lesion removing an inhibitory influence over dopamine neurotransmission.",

abstract="Poor impulse control is a debilitating condition observed in various psychiatric disorders and could be a risk factor for drug addiction, criminal involvement, and suicide. The rat infralimbic cortex (IL), located in the ventral portion of the medial prefrontal cortex, has been implicated in impulse control. To elucidate the neurophysiological basis of impulse control, we recorded single unit activity in the IL of a rat performing a 3-choiceserial reaction time task (3-CSRTT) and 2-choice task (2-CT), which are animal models for impulsivity. The inactivation of IL neuronal activity with an injection of muscimol (0.1 $\mu$g /side) disrupted impulse control in the 3-CSRTT. More than 60\% (38/56) of isolated IL units were linked to impulse control, while approximately 30\% of all units were linked to attentional function in the 3-CSRTT. To avoid confounding motor-related units with the impulse control-related units, we further conducted the 2-CT in which the animals' motor activities were restricted during recording window. More than 30\% (14/44) of recorded IL units were linked to impulse control in the 2-CT. Several types of impulse control-related units were identified. Only 16\% of all units were compatible with the results of the muscimol experiment, which showed a transient decline in the firing rate immediately before the release of behavioral inhibition. This is the first study to elucidate the neurophysiological basis of impulse control in the IL and to propose that IL neurons control impulsive actions in a more complex manner than previously considered.",

abstract="In rodents, the five-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) has been established as a reliable measure of waiting impulsivity being defined as the ability to regulate a response in anticipation of reinforcement. Key brain structures are the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and prefrontal regions (for example, pre- and infralimbic cortex), which are, together with other transmitters, modulated by serotonin. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we examined 103 healthy males while performing the 5-CSRTT measuring brain activation in humans by means of a paradigm that has been widely applied in rodents. Subjects were genotyped for the tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (TPH2; G-703T; rs4570625) variant, an enzyme specific for brain serotonin synthesis. We addressed neural activation patterns of waiting impulsivity and the interaction between the NAcc and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) using dynamic causal modeling. Genetic influence was examined via interaction analyses between the TPH2 genotype (GG homozygotes vs T allele carriers) and the degree of impulsivity as measured by the 5-CSRTT. We found that the driving input of the vmPFC was reduced in highly impulsive T allele carriers (reflecting a reduced top-down control) in combination with an enhanced response in the NAcc after correct target processing (reflecting an augmented response to monetary reward). Taken together, we found a high overlap of our findings with reports from animal studies in regard to the underlying cognitive processes, the brain regions associated with waiting impulsivity and the neural interplay between the NAcc and vmPFC. Therefore, we conclude that the 5-CSRTT is a promising tool for translational studies.",

abstract="In many circumstances alternative courses of action and thoughts have to be inhibited to allow the emergence of goal-directed behavior. However, this has not been the accepted view in the past and only recently has inhibition earned its own place in the neurosciences as a fundamental cognitive function. In this review we first introduce the concept of inhibition from early psychological speculations based on philosophical theories of the human mind. The broad construct of inhibition is then reduced to its most readily observable component which necessarily is its behavioral manifestation. The study of 'response inhibition' has the advantage of dealing with a relatively simple and straightforward process, the overriding of a planned or already initiated action. Deficient inhibitory processes profoundly affect everyday life, causing impulsive conduct which is generally detrimental for the individual. Impulsivity has been consistently linked to several types of addiction, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, mania and other psychiatric conditions. Our discussion of the behavioral assessment of impulsivity will focus on objective laboratory tasks of response inhibition that have been implemented in parallel for humans and other species with relatively few qualitative differences. The translational potential of these measures has greatly improved our knowledge of the neurobiological basis of behavioral inhibition and impulsivity. We will then review the current models of behavioral inhibition along with their expression via underlying brain regions, including those involved in the activation of the brain's emergency 'brake' operation, those engaged in more controlled and sustained inhibitory processes and other ancillary executive functions.",

abstract="Many common psychiatric conditions, such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Parkinson's disease, addiction and pathological gambling are linked by a failure in the mechanisms that control, or inhibit, inappropriate behavior. Models of rat behavioral inhibition permit us to study in detail the anatomical and pharmacological bases of inhibitory failure, using methods that translate directly with patient assessment in the clinic. This review updates current ideas relating to behavioral inhibition based on two significant lines of evidence from rat studies: (1) To integrate new findings from the stop-signal task into existing models of behavioral inhibition, in particular relating to 'impulsive action' control. The stop-signal task has been used for a number of years to evaluate psychiatric conditions and has recently been translated for use in the rat, bringing a wealth of new information to behavioral inhibition research. (2) To consider the importance of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in the neural circuitry of behavioral inhibition. This function of this nucleus is central to a number of 'disinhibitory' disorders such as Parkinson's disease and OCD, and their therapies, but its role in behavioral inhibition is still undervalued, and often not considered in preclinical models of behavioral control. Integration of these findings has pinpointed the orbitofrontal cortex (OF), dorsomedial striatum (DMStr) and STN within a network that normally inhibits many forms of behavior, including both impulsive and compulsive forms. However, there are distinct differences between behavioral subtypes in their neurochemical modulation. This review brings new light to the classical view of the mechanisms that inhibit behavior, in particular suggesting a far more prominent role for the STN, a structure that is usually omitted from conventional behavioral-inhibition networks. The OF-DMStr-STN circuitry may form the basis of a control network that defines behavioral inhibition and that acts to suppress or countermand many forms of inappropriate or maladaptive behavior.",
